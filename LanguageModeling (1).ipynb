.', 'it was built of a bright brick throughout  its sky  line was fantastic  and even its ground plan was wild .', 'it had been the outburst of a speculative builder  faintly tinged with art  who called its architecture sometimes elizabethan and sometimes queen anne  apparently under the impression that the two sovereigns were identical .', 'it was described with some justice as an artistic colony  though it never in any definable way produced any art .', 'but although its pretensions to be an intellectual centre were a little vague  its pretensions to be a pleasant place were quite indisputable .', 'the stranger who looked for the first time at the quaint red houses could only think how very oddly shaped the people must be who could fit in to them .', 'nor when he met the people was he disappointed in this respect .', 'the place was not only pleasant  but perfect  if once he could regard it not as a deception but rather as a dream .', 'even if the people were not  artists  the whole was nevertheless artistic .', 'that young man with the long  auburn hair and the impudent face  that young man was not really a poet  but surely he was a poem .', 'that old gentleman with the wild  white beard and the wild  white hat  that venerable humbug was not really a philosopher  but at least he was the cause of philosophy in others .', 'that scientific gentleman with the bald  egg  like head and the bare  bird  like neck had no real right to the airs of science that he assumed .', 'he had not discovered anything new in biology  but what biological creature could he have discovered more singular than himself ', 'thus  and thus only  the whole place had properly to be regarded  it had to be considered not so much as a workshop for artists  but as a frail but finished work of art .', 'a man who stepped into its social atmosphere felt as if he had stepped into a written comedy .', 'more especially this attractive unreality fell upon it about nightfall  when the extravagant roofs were dark against the afterglow and the whole insane village seemed as separate as a drifting cloud .', 'this again was more strongly true of the many nights of local festivity  when the little gardens were often illuminated  and the big chinese lanterns glowed in the dwarfish trees like some fierce and monstrous fruit .', 'and this was strongest of all on one particular evening  still vaguely remembered in the locality  of which the auburn  haired poet was the hero .', 'it was not by any means the only evening of which he was the hero .', 'on many nights those passing by his little back garden might hear his high  didactic voice laying down the law to men and particularly to women .', 'the attitude of women in such cases was indeed one of the paradoxes of the place .', 'most of the women were of the kind vaguely called emancipated  and professed some protest against male supremacy .', 'yet these new women would always pay to a man the extravagant compliment which no ordinary woman ever pays to him  that of listening while he is talking .', 'and mr . lucian gregory  the red  haired poet  was really  in some sense  a man worth listening to  even if one only laughed at the end of it .', 'he put the old cant of the lawlessness of art and the art of lawlessness with a certain impudent freshness which gave at least a momentary pleasure .', 'he was helped in some degree by the arresting oddity of his appearance  which he worked  as the phrase goes  for all it was worth .', 'his dark red hair parted in the middle was literally like a woman  s  and curved into the slow curls of a virgin in a pre  raphaelite picture .', 'from within this almost saintly oval  however  his face projected suddenly broad and brutal  the chin carried forward with a look of cockney contempt .', 'this combination at once tickled and terrified the nerves of a neurotic population .', 'he seemed like a walking blasphemy  a blend of the angel and the ape .', 'this particular evening  if it is remembered for nothing else  will be remembered in that place for its strange sunset .', 'it looked like the end of the world .', 'all the heaven seemed covered with a quite vivid and palpable plumage  you could only say that the sky was full of feathers  and of feathers that almost brushed the face .', 'across the great part of the dome they were grey  with the strangest tints of violet and mauve and an unnatural pink or pale green  but towards the west the whole grew past description  transparent and passionate  and the last red  hot plumes of it covered up the sun like something too good to be seen .', 'the whole was so close about the earth  as to express nothing but a violent secrecy .', 'the very empyrean seemed to be a secret .', 'it expressed that splendid smallness which is the soul of local patriotism .', 'the very sky seemed small .', 'i say that there are some inhabitants who may remember the evening if only by that oppressive sky .', 'there are others who may remember it because it marked the first appearance in the place of the second poet of saffron park .', 'for a long time the red  haired revolutionary had reigned without a rival  it was upon the night of the sunset that his solitude suddenly ended .', 'the new poet  who introduced himself by the name of gabriel syme was a very mild  looking mortal  with a fair  pointed beard and faint  yellow hair .', 'but an impression grew that he was less meek than he looked .', 'he signalised his entrance by differing with the established poet  gregory  upon the whole nature of poetry .', 'he said that he  syme  was poet of law  a poet of order  nay  he said he was a poet of respectability .', 'so all the saffron parkers looked at him as if he had that moment fallen out of that impossible sky .', 'in fact  mr . lucian gregory  the anarchic poet  connected the two events .', ' it may well be  he said  in his sudden lyrical manner   it may well be on such a night of clouds and cruel colours that there is brought forth upon the earth such a portent as a respectable poet .', 'you say you are a poet of law  i say you are a contradiction in terms .', 'i only wonder there were not comets and earthquakes on the night you appeared in this garden .', 'the man with the meek blue eyes and the pale  pointed beard endured these thunders with a certain submissive solemnity .', 'the third party of the group  gregory  s sister rosamond  who had her brother  s braids of red hair  but a kindlier face underneath them  laughed with such mixture of admiration and disapproval as she gave commonly to the family oracle .', 'gregory resumed in high oratorical good humour .', ' an artist is identical with an anarchist  he cried .', ' you might transpose the words anywhere .', 'an anarchist is an artist .', 'the man who throws a bomb is an artist  because he prefers a great moment to everything .', 'he sees how much more valuable is one burst of blazing light  one peal of perfect thunder  than the mere common bodies of a few shapeless policemen .', 'an artist disregards all governments  abolishes all conventions .', 'the poet delights in disorder only .', 'if it were not so  the most poetical thing in the world would be the underground railway .', ' so it is  said mr . syme .', ' nonsense ', 'said gregory  who was very rational when anyone else attempted paradox .', ' why do all the clerks and navvies in the railway trains look so sad and tired  so very sad and tired ', 'i will tell you .', 'it is because they know that the train is going right .', 'it is because they know that whatever place they have taken a ticket for that place they will reach .', 'it is because after they have passed sloane square they know that the next station must be victoria  and nothing but victoria .', 'oh  their wild rapture ', 'oh  their eyes like stars and their souls again in eden  if the next station were unaccountably baker street ', ' it is you who are unpoetical  replied the poet syme .', ' if what you say of clerks is true  they can only be as prosaic as your poetry .', 'the rare  strange thing is to hit the mark  the gross  obvious thing is to miss it .', 'we feel it is epical when man with one wild arrow strikes a distant bird .', 'is it not also epical when man with one wild engine strikes a distant station ', 'chaos is dull  because in chaos the train might indeed go anywhere  to baker street or to bagdad .', 'but man is a magician  and his whole magic is in this  that he does say victoria  and lo ', 'it is victoria .', 'no  take your books of mere poetry and prose  let me read a time table  with tears of pride .', 'take your byron  who commemorates the defeats of man  give me bradshaw  who commemorates his victories .', 'give me bradshaw  i say ', ' must you go ', 'inquired gregory sarcastically .', ' i tell you  went on syme with passion   that every time a train comes in i feel that it has broken past batteries of besiegers  and that man has won a battle against chaos .', 'you say contemptuously that when one has left sloane square one must come to victoria .', 'i say that one might do a thousand things instead  and that whenever i really come there i have the sense of hairbreadth escape .', 'and when i hear the guard shout out the word  victoria  it is not an unmeaning word .', 'it is to me the cry of a herald announcing conquest .', 'it is to me indeed  victoria  it is the victory of adam .', 'gregory wagged his heavy  red head with a slow and sad smile .', ' and even then  he said   we poets always ask the question   and what is victoria now that you have got there ', 'you think victoria is like the new jerusalem .', 'we know that the new jerusalem will only be like victoria .', 'yes  the poet will be discontented even in the streets of heaven .', 'the poet is always in revolt .', ' there again  said syme irritably   what is there poetical about being in revolt ', 'you might as well say that it is poetical to be sea  sick .', 'being sick is a revolt .', 'both being sick and being rebellious may be the wholesome thing on certain desperate occasions  but i  m hanged if i can see why they are poetical .', 'revolt in the abstract is  revolting .', 'it  s mere vomiting .', 'the girl winced for a flash at the unpleasant word  but syme was too hot to heed her .', ' it is things going right  he cried   that is poetical i our digestions  for instance  going sacredly and silently right  that is the foundation of all poetry .', 'yes  the most poetical thing  more poetical than the flowers  more poetical than the stars  the most poetical thing in the world is not being sick .', ' really  said gregory superciliously   the examples you choose ', ' i beg your pardon  said syme grimly   i forgot we had abolished all conventions .', 'for the first time a red patch appeared on gregory  s forehead .', ' you don  t expect me  he said   to revolutionise society on this lawn ', 'syme looked straight into his eyes and smiled sweetly .', ' no  i don  t  he said   but i suppose that if you were serious about your anarchism  that is exactly what you would do .', 'gregory  s big bull  s eyes blinked suddenly like those of an angry lion  and one could almost fancy that his red mane rose .', ' don  t you think  then  he said in a dangerous voice   that i am serious about my anarchism ', ' i beg your pardon ', 'said syme .', ' am i not serious about my anarchism ', 'cried gregory  with knotted fists .', ' my dear fellow ', 'said syme  and strolled away .', 'with surprise  but with a curious pleasure  he found rosamond gregory still in his company .', ' mr . syme  she said   do the people who talk like you and my brother often mean what they say ', 'do you mean what you say now ', 'syme smiled .', ' do you ', 'he asked .', ' what do you mean ', 'asked the girl  with grave eyes .', ' my dear miss gregory  said syme gently   there are many kinds of sincerity and insincerity .', 'when you say  thank you  for the salt  do you mean what you say ', 'no .', 'when you say  the world is round  do you mean what you say ', 'no .', 'it is true  but you don  t mean it .', 'now  sometimes a man like your brother really finds a thing he does mean .', 'it may be only a half  truth  quarter  truth  tenth  truth  but then he says more than he means  from sheer force of meaning it .', 'she was looking at him from under level brows  her face was grave and open  and there had fallen upon it the shadow of that unreasoning responsibility which is at the bottom of the most frivolous woman  the maternal watch which is as old as the world .', ' is he really an anarchist  then ', 'she asked .', ' only in that sense i speak of  replied syme   or if you prefer it  in that nonsense .', 'she drew her broad brows together and said abruptly ', ' he wouldn  t really use  bombs or that sort of thing ', 'syme broke into a great laugh  that seemed too large for his slight and somewhat dandified figure .', ' good lord  no ', 'he said   that has to be done anonymously .', 'and at that the corners of her own mouth broke into a smile  and she thought with a simultaneous pleasure of gregory  s absurdity and of his safety .', 'syme strolled with her to a seat in the corner of the garden  and continued to pour out his opinions .', 'for he was a sincere man  and in spite of his superficial airs and graces  at root a humble one .', 'and it is always the humble man who talks too much  the proud man watches himself too closely .', 'he defended respectability with violence and exaggeration .', 'he grew passionate in his praise of tidiness and propriety .', 'all the time there was a smell of lilac all round him .', 'once he heard very faintly in some distant street a barrel  organ begin to play  and it seemed to him that his heroic words were moving to a tiny tune from under or beyond the world .', 'he stared and talked at the girl  s red hair and amused face for what seemed to be a few minutes  and then  feeling that the groups in such a place should mix  rose to his feet .', 'to his astonishment  he discovered the whole garden empty .', 'everyone had gone long ago  and he went himself with a rather hurried apology .', 'he left with a sense of champagne in his head  which he could not afterwards explain .', 'in the wild events which were to follow this girl had no part at all  he never saw her again until all his tale was over .', 'and yet  in some indescribable way  she kept recurring like a motive in music through all his mad adventures afterwards  and the glory of her strange hair ran like a red thread through those dark and ill  drawn tapestries of the night .', 'for what followed was so improbable  that it might well have been a dream .', 'when syme went out into the starlit street  he found it for the moment empty .', 'then he realised  in some odd way  that the silence was rather a living silence than a dead one .', 'directly outside the door stood a street lamp  whose gleam gilded the leaves of the tree that bent out over the fence behind him .', 'about a foot from the lamp  post stood a figure almost as rigid and motionless as the lamp  post itself .', 'the tall hat and long frock coat were black  the face  in an abrupt shadow  was almost as dark .', 'only a fringe of fiery hair against the light  and also something aggressive in the attitude  proclaimed that it was the poet gregory .', 'he had something of the look of a masked bravo waiting sword in hand for his foe .', 'he made a sort of doubtful salute  which syme somewhat more formally returned .', ' i was waiting for you  said gregory .', ' might i have a moment  s conversation ', ' certainly .', 'about what ', 'asked syme in a sort of weak wonder .', 'gregory struck out with his stick at the lamp  post  and then at the tree .', ' about this and this  he cried   about order and anarchy .', 'there is your precious order  that lean  iron lamp  ugly and barren  and there is anarchy  rich  living  reproducing itself  there is anarchy  splendid in green and gold .', ' all the same  replied syme patiently   just at present you only see the tree by the light of the lamp .', 'i wonder when you would ever see the lamp by the light of the tree .', 'then after a pause he said   but may i ask if you have been standing out here in the dark only to resume our little argument ', ' no  cried out gregory  in a voice that rang down the street   i did not stand here to resume our argument  but to end it for ever .', 'the silence fell again  and syme  though he understood nothing  listened instinctively for something serious .', 'gregory began in a smooth voice and with a rather bewildering smile .', ' mr . syme  he said   this evening you succeeded in doing something rather remarkable .', 'you did something to me that no man born of woman has ever succeeded in doing before .', ' indeed ', ' now i remember  resumed gregory reflectively   one other person succeeded in doing it .', 'the captain of a penny steamer  if i remember correctly  at southend .', 'you have irritated me .', ' i am very sorry  replied syme with gravity .', ' i am afraid my fury and your insult are too shocking to be wiped out even with an apology  said gregory very calmly .', ' no duel could wipe it out .', 'if i struck you dead i could not wipe it out .', 'there is only one way by which that insult can be erased  and that way i choose .', 'i am going  at the possible sacrifice of my life and honour  to prove to you that you were wrong in what you said .', ' in what i said ', ' you said i was not serious about being an anarchist .', ' there are degrees of seriousness  replied syme .', ' i have never doubted that you were perfectly sincere in this sense  that you thought what you said well worth saying  that you thought a paradox might wake men up to a neglected truth .', 'gregory stared at him steadily and painfully .', ' and in no other sense  he asked   you think me serious ', 'you think me a flaneur who lets fall occasional truths .', 'you do not think that in a deeper  a more deadly sense  i am serious .', 'syme struck his stick violently on the stones of the road .', ' serious ', 'he cried .', ' good lord ', 'is this street serious ', 'are these damned chinese lanterns serious ', 'is the whole caboodle serious ', 'one comes here and talks a pack of bosh  and perhaps some sense as well  but i should think very little of a man who didn  t keep something in the background of his life that was more serious than all this talking  something more serious  whether it was religion or only drink .', ' very well  said gregory  his face darkening   you shall see something more serious than either drink or religion .', 'syme stood waiting with his usual air of mildness until gregory again opened his lips .', ' you spoke just now of having a religion .', 'is it really true that you have one ', ' oh  said syme with a beaming smile   we are all catholics now .', ' then may i ask you to swear by whatever gods or saints your religion involves that you will not reveal what i am now going to tell you to any son of adam  and especially not to the police ', 'will you swear that ', 'if you will take upon yourself this awful abnegations if you will consent to burden your soul with a vow that you should never make and a knowledge you should never dream about  i will promise you in return ', ' you will promise me in return ', 'inquired syme  as the other paused .', ' i will promise you a very entertaining evening .', 'syme suddenly took off his hat .', ' your offer  he said   is far too idiotic to be declined .', 'you say that a poet is always an anarchist .', 'i disagree  but i hope at least that he is always a sportsman .', 'permit me  here and now  to swear as a christian  and promise as a good comrade and a fellow  artist  that i will not report anything of this  whatever it is  to the police .', 'and now  in the name of colney hatch  what is it ', ' i think  said gregory  with placid irrelevancy   that we will call a cab .', 'he gave two long whistles  and a hansom came rattling down the road .', 'the two got into it in silence .', 'gregory gave through the trap the address of an obscure public  house on the chiswick bank of the river .', 'the cab whisked itself away again  and in it these two fantastics quitted their fantastic town .', 'chapter ii', 'the secret of gabriel syme', 'the cab pulled up before a particularly dreary and greasy beershop  into which gregory rapidly conducted his companion .', 'they seated themselves in a close and dim sort of bar  parlour  at a stained wooden table with one wooden leg .', 'the room was so small and dark  that very little could be seen of the attendant who was summoned  beyond a vague and dark impression of something bulky and bearded .', ' will you take a little supper ', 'asked gregory politely .', ' the pate de foie gras is not good here  but i can recommend the game .', 'syme received the remark with stolidity  imagining it to be a joke .', 'accepting the vein of humour  he said  with a well  bred indifference ', ' oh  bring me some lobster mayonnaise .', 'to his indescribable astonishment  the man only said  certainly  sir ', 'and went away apparently to get it .', ' what will you drink ', 'resumed gregory  with the same careless yet apologetic air .', ' i shall only have a crepe de menthe myself  i have dined .', 'but the champagne can really be trusted .', 'do let me start you with a half  bottle of pommery at least ', ' thank you ', 'said the motionless syme .', ' you are very good .', 'his further attempts at conversation  somewhat disorganised in themselves  were cut short finally as by a thunderbolt by the actual appearance of the lobster .', 'syme tasted it  and found it particularly good .', 'then he suddenly began to eat with great rapidity and appetite .', ' excuse me if i enjoy myself rather obviously ', 'he said to gregory  smiling .', ' i don  t often have the luck to have a dream like this .', 'it is new to me for a nightmare to lead to a lobster .', 'it is commonly the other way .', ' you are not asleep  i assure you  said gregory .', ' you are  on the contrary  close to the most actual and rousing moment of your existence .', 'ah  here comes your champagne ', 'i admit that there may be a slight disproportion  let us say  between the inner arrangements of this excellent hotel and its simple and unpretentious exterior .', 'but that is all our modesty .', 'we are the most modest men that ever lived on earth .', ' and who are we ', 'asked syme  emptying his champagne glass .', ' it is quite simple  replied gregory .', ' we are the serious anarchists  in whom you do not believe .', ' oh ', 'said syme shortly .', ' you do yourselves well in drinks .', ' yes  we are serious about everything  answered gregory .', 'then after a pause he added ', ' if in a few moments this table begins to turn round a little  don  t put it down to your inroads into the champagne .', 'i don  t wish you to do yourself an injustice .', ' well  if i am not drunk  i am mad  replied syme with perfect calm   but i trust i can behave like a gentleman in either condition .', 'may i smoke ', ' certainly ', 'said gregory  producing a cigar  case .', ' try one of mine .', 'syme took the cigar  clipped the end off with a cigar  cutter out of his waistcoat pocket  put it in his mouth  lit it slowly  and let out a long cloud of smoke .', 'it is not a little to his credit that he performed these rites with so much composure  for almost before he had begun them the table at which he sat had begun to revolve  first slowly  and then rapidly  as if at an insane seance .', ' you must not mind it  said gregory   it  s a kind of screw .', ' quite so  said syme placidly   a kind of screw .', 'how simple that is ', 'the next moment the smoke of his cigar  which had been wavering across the room in snaky twists  went straight up as if from a factory chimney  and the two  with their chairs and table  shot down through the floor as if the earth had swallowed them .', 'they went rattling down a kind of roaring chimney as rapidly as a lift cut loose  and they came with an abrupt bump to the bottom .', 'but when gregory threw open a pair of doors and let in a red subterranean light  syme was still smoking with one leg thrown over the other  and had not turned a yellow hair .', 'gregory led him down a low  vaulted passage  at the end of which was the red light .', 'it was an enormous crimson lantern  nearly as big as a fireplace  fixed over a small but heavy iron door .', 'in the door there was a sort of hatchway or grating  and on this gregory struck five times .', 'a heavy voice with a foreign accent asked him who he was .', 'to this he gave the more or less unexpected reply   mr . joseph chamberlain .', 'the heavy hinges began to move  it was obviously some kind of password .', 'inside the doorway the passage gleamed as if it were lined with a network of steel .', 'on a second glance  syme saw that the glittering pattern was really made up of ranks and ranks of rifles and revolvers  closely packed or interlocked .', ' i must ask you to forgive me all these formalities  said gregory   we have to be very strict here .', ' oh  don  t apologise  said syme .', ' i know your passion for law and order  and he stepped into the passage lined with the steel weapons .', 'with his long  fair hair and rather foppish frock  coat  he looked a singularly frail and fanciful figure as he walked down that shining avenue of death .', 'they passed through several such passages  and came out at last into a queer steel chamber with curved walls  almost spherical in shape  but presenting  with its tiers of benches  something of the appearance of a scientific lecture  theatre .', 'there were no rifles or pistols in this apartment  but round the walls of it were hung more dubious and dreadful shapes  things that looked like the bulbs of iron plants  or the eggs of iron birds .', 'they were bombs  and the very room itself seemed like the inside of a bomb .', 'syme knocked his cigar ash off against the wall  and went in .', ' and now  my dear mr . syme  said gregory  throwing himself in an expansive manner on the bench under the largest bomb   now we are quite cosy  so let us talk properly .', 'now no human words can give you any notion of why i brought you here .', 'it was one of those quite arbitrary emotions  like jumping off a cliff or falling in love .', 'suffice it to say that you were an inexpressibly irritating fellow  and  to do you justice  you are still .', 'i would break twenty oaths of secrecy for the pleasure of taking you down a peg .', 'that way you have of lighting a cigar would make a priest break the seal of confession .', 'well  you said that you were quite certain i was not a serious anarchist .', 'does this place strike you as being serious ', ' it does seem to have a moral under all its gaiety  assented syme   but may i ask you two questions ', 'you need not fear to give me information  because  as you remember  you very wisely extorted from me a promise not to tell the police  a promise i shall certainly keep .', 'so it is in mere curiosity that i make my queries .', 'first of all  what is it really all about ', 'what is it you object to ', 'you want to abolish government ', ' to abolish god ', 'said gregory  opening the eyes of a fanatic .', ' we do not only want to upset a few despotisms and police regulations  that sort of anarchism does exist  but it is a mere branch of the nonconformists .', 'we dig deeper and we blow you higher .', 'we wish to deny all those arbitrary distinctions of vice and virtue  honour and treachery  upon which mere rebels base themselves .', 'the silly sentimentalists of the french revolution talked of the rights of man ', 'we hate rights as we hate wrongs .', 'we have abolished right and wrong .', ' and right and left  said syme with a simple eagerness   i hope you will abolish them too .', 'they are much more troublesome to me .', ' you spoke of a second question  snapped gregory .', ' with pleasure  resumed syme .', ' in all your present acts and surroundings there is a scientific attempt at secrecy .', 'i have an aunt who lived over a shop  but this is the first time i have found people living from preference under a public  house .', 'you have a heavy iron door .', 'you cannot pass it without submitting to the humiliation of calling yourself mr . chamberlain .', 'you surround yourself with steel instruments which make the place  if i may say so  more impressive than homelike .', 'may i ask why  after taking all this trouble to barricade yourselves in the bowels of the earth  you then parade your whole secret by talking about anarchism to every silly woman in saffron park ', 'gregory smiled .', ' the answer is simple  he said .', ' i told you i was a serious anarchist  and you did not believe me .', 'nor do they believe me .', 'unless i took them into this infernal room they would not believe me .', 'syme smoked thoughtfully  and looked at him with interest .', 'gregory went on .', ' the history of the thing might amuse you  he said .', ' when first i became one of the new anarchists i tried all kinds of respectable disguises .', 'i dressed up as a bishop .', 'i read up all about bishops in our anarchist pamphlets  in superstition the vampire and priests of prey .', 'i certainly understood from them that bishops are strange and terrible old men keeping a cruel secret from mankind .', 'i was misinformed .', 'when on my first appearing in episcopal gaiters in a drawing  room i cried out in a voice of thunder   down ', 'down ', 'presumptuous human reason ', 'they found out in some way that i was not a bishop at all .', 'i was nabbed at once .', 'then i made up as a millionaire  but i defended capital with so much intelligence that a fool could see that i was quite poor .', 'then i tried being a major .', 'now i am a humanitarian myself  but i have  i hope  enough intellectual breadth to understand the position of those who  like nietzsche  admire violence  the proud  mad war of nature and all that  you know .', 'i threw myself into the major .', 'i drew my sword and waved it constantly .', 'i called out  blood ', 'abstractedly  like a man calling for wine .', 'i often said   let the weak perish  it is the law .', 'well  well  it seems majors don  t do this .', 'i was nabbed again .', 'at last i went in despair to the president of the central anarchist council  who is the greatest man in europe .', ' what is his name ', 'asked syme .', ' you would not know it  answered gregory .', ' that is his greatness .', 'caesar and napoleon put all their genius into being heard of  and they were heard of .', 'he puts all his genius into not being heard of  and he is not heard of .', 'but you cannot be for five minutes in the room with him without feeling that caesar and napoleon would have been children in his hands .', 'he was silent and even pale for a moment  and then resumed ', ' but whenever he gives advice it is always something as startling as an epigram  and yet as practical as the bank of england .', 'i said to him   what disguise will hide me from the world ', 'what can i find more respectable than bishops and majors ', 'he looked at me with his large but indecipherable face .', ' you want a safe disguise  do you ', 'you want a dress which will guarantee you harmless  a dress in which no one would ever look for a bomb ', 'i nodded .', 'he suddenly lifted his lion  s voice .', ' why  then  dress up as an anarchist  you fool ', 'he roared so that the room shook .', ' nobody will ever expect you to do anything dangerous then .', 'and he turned his broad back on me without another word .', 'i took his advice  and have never regretted it .', 'i preached blood and murder to those women day and night  and  by god  they would let me wheel their perambulators .', 'syme sat watching him with some respect in his large  blue eyes .', ' you took me in  he said .', ' it is really a smart dodge .', 'then after a pause he added ', ' what do you call this tremendous president of yours ', ' we generally call him sunday  replied gregory with simplicity .', ' you see  there are seven members of the central anarchist council  and they are named after days of the week .', 'he is called sunday  by some of his admirers bloody sunday .', 'it is curious you should mention the matter  because the very night you have dropped in  if i may so express it  is the night on which our london branch  which assembles in this room  has to elect its own deputy to fill a vacancy in the council .', 'the gentleman who has for some time past played  with propriety and general applause  the difficult part of thursday  has died quite suddenly .', 'consequently  we have called a meeting this very evening to elect a successor .', 'he got to his feet and strolled across the room with a sort of smiling embarrassment .', ' i feel somehow as if you were my mother  syme  he continued casually .', ' i feel that i can confide anything to you  as you have promised to tell nobody .', 'in fact  i will confide to you something that i would not say in so many words to the anarchists who will be coming to the room in about ten minutes .', 'we shall  of course  go through a form of election  but i don  t mind telling you that it is practically certain what the result will be .', 'he looked down for a moment modestly .', ' it is almost a settled thing that i am to be thursday .', ' my dear fellow .', 'said syme heartily   i congratulate you .', 'a great career ', 'gregory smiled in deprecation  and walked across the room  talking rapidly .', ' as a matter of fact  everything is ready for me on this table  he said   and the ceremony will probably be the shortest possible .', 'syme also strolled across to the table  and found lying across it a walking  stick  which turned out on examination to be a sword  stick  a large colt  s revolver  a sandwich case  and a formidable flask of brandy .', 'over the chair  beside the table  was thrown a heavy  looking cape or cloak .', ' i have only to get the form of election finished  continued gregory with animation   then i snatch up this cloak and stick  stuff these other things into my pocket  step out of a door in this cavern  which opens on the river  where there is a steam  tug already waiting for me  and then  then  oh  the wild joy of being thursday ', 'and he clasped his hands .', 'syme  who had sat down once more with his usual insolent languor  got to his feet with an unusual air of hesitation .', ' why is it  he asked vaguely   that i think you are quite a decent fellow ', 'why do i positively like you  gregory ', 'he paused a moment  and then added with a sort of fresh curiosity   is it because you are such an ass ', 'there was a thoughtful silence again  and then he cried out ', ' well  damn it all ', 'this is the funniest situation i have ever been in in my life  and i am going to act accordingly .', 'gregory  i gave you a promise before i came into this place .', 'that promise i would keep under red  hot pincers .', 'would you give me  for my own safety  a little promise of the same kind  ', ' a promise ', 'asked gregory  wondering .', ' yes  said syme very seriously   a promise .', 'i swore before god that i would not tell your secret to the police .', 'will you swear by humanity  or whatever beastly thing you believe in  that you will not tell my secret to the anarchists ', ' your secret ', 'asked the staring gregory .', ' have you got a secret ', ' yes  said syme   i have a secret .', 'then after a pause   will you swear ', 'gregory glared at him gravely for a few moments  and then said abruptly ', ' you must have bewitched me  but i feel a furious curiosity about you .', 'yes  i will swear not to tell the anarchists anything you tell me .', 'but look sharp  for they will be here in a couple of minutes .', 'syme rose slowly to his feet and thrust his long  white hands into his long  grey trousers  pockets .', 'almost as he did so there came five knocks on the outer grating  proclaiming the arrival of the first of the conspirators .', ' well  said syme slowly   i don  t know how to tell you the truth more shortly than by saying that your expedient of dressing up as an aimless poet is not confined to you or your president .', 'we have known the dodge for some time at scotland yard .', 'gregory tried to spring up straight  but he swayed thrice .', ' what do you say ', 'he asked in an inhuman voice .', ' yes  said syme simply   i am a police detective .', 'but i think i hear your friends coming .', 'from the doorway there came a murmur of  mr . joseph chamberlain .', 'it was repeated twice and thrice  and then thirty times  and the crowd of joseph chamberlains  a solemn thought  could be heard trampling down the corridor .', 'chapter iii', 'the man who was thursday', 'before one of the fresh faces could appear at the doorway  gregory  s stunned surprise had fallen from him .', 'he was beside the table with a bound  and a noise in his throat like a wild beast .', 'he caught up the colt  s revolver and took aim at syme .', 'syme did not flinch  but he put up a pale and polite hand .', ' don  t be such a silly man  he said  with the effeminate dignity of a curate .', ' don  t you see it  s not necessary ', 'don  t you see that we  re both in the same boat ', 'yes  and jolly sea  sick .', 'gregory could not speak  but he could not fire either  and he looked his question .', ' don  t you see we  ve checkmated each other ', 'cried syme .', ' i can  t tell the police you are an anarchist .', 'you can  t tell the anarchists i  m a policeman .', 'i can only watch you  knowing what you are  you can only watch me  knowing what i am .', 'in short  it  s a lonely  intellectual duel  my head against yours .', 'i  m a policeman deprived of the help of the police .', 'you  my poor fellow  are an anarchist deprived of the help of that law and organisation which is so essential to anarchy .', 'the one solitary difference is in your favour .', 'you are not surrounded by inquisitive policemen  i am surrounded by inquisitive anarchists .', 'i cannot betray you  but i might betray myself .', 'come  come ', 'wait and see me betray myself .', 'i shall do it so nicely .', 'gregory put the pistol slowly down  still staring at syme as if he were a sea  monster .', ' i don  t believe in immortality  he said at last   but if  after all this  you were to break your word  god would make a hell only for you  to howl in for ever .', ' i shall not break my word  said syme sternly   nor will you break yours .', 'here are your friends .', 'the mass of the anarchists entered the room heavily  with a slouching and somewhat weary gait  but one little man  with a black beard and glasses  a man somewhat of the type of mr . tim healy  detached himself  and bustled forward with some papers in his hand .', ' comrade gregory  he said   i suppose this man is a delegate ', 'gregory  taken by surprise  looked down and muttered the name of syme  but syme replied almost pertly ', ' i am glad to see that your gate is well enough guarded to

papers after a pause   i suppose we  d better give you a seat in the meeting ', ' if you ask my advice as a friend  said syme with severe benevolence   i think you  d better .', 'when gregory heard the dangerous dialogue end  with a sudden safety for his rival  he rose abruptly and paced the floor in painful thought .', 'he was  indeed  in an agony of diplomacy .', 'it was clear that syme  s inspired impudence was likely to bring him out of all merely accidental dilemmas .', 'little was to be hoped from them .', 'he could not himself betray syme  partly from honour  but partly also because  if he betrayed him and for some reason failed to destroy him  the syme who escaped would be a syme freed from all obligation of secrecy  a syme who would simply walk to the nearest police station .', 'after all  it was only one night  s discussion  and only one detective who would know of it .', 'he would let out as little as possible of their plans that night  and then let syme go  and chance it .', 'he strode across to the group of anarchists  which was already distributing itself along the benches .', ' i think it is time we began  he said   the steam  tug is waiting on the river already .', 'i move that comrade buttons takes the chair .', 'this being approved by a show of hands  the little man with the papers slipped into the presidential seat .', ' comrades  he began

elected many and splendid thursdays .', 'we all lament the sad decease of the heroic worker who occupied the post until last week .', 'as you know  his services to the cause were considerable .', 'he organised the great dynamite coup of brighton which  under happier circumstances  ought to have killed everybody on the pier .', 'as you also know  his death was as self  denying as his life  for he died through his faith in a hygienic mixture of chalk and water as a substitute for milk  which beverage he regarded as barbaric  and as involving cruelty to the cow .', 'cruelty  or anything

pointed beard seconded .', ' before i put the matter to the vote  said the chairman   i will call on comrade gregory to make a statement .', 'gregory rose amid a great rumble of applause .', 'his face was deadly pale  so that by contrast his queer red hair looked almost scarlet .', 'but he was smiling and altogether at ease .', 'he had made up his mind  and he saw his best policy quite plain in front of him like a white road .', 'his best chance was to make a softened and ambiguous speech  such as would leave on the detective  s mind the impression that the anarchist brotherhood was a very mild affair after all .', 'he believed in his own literary power  his capacity for suggesting fine shades and picking perfect words .', 'he thought that with care he could succeed  in spite of all the people around him  in conveying an impression of the institution  subtly and delicately false .', 'syme had once thought that anarchists  under all their bravado  were only playing the fool .', 'could he not now  in the hour of peril  make syme think so again ', ' comrades  began gregory  in a low but penetrating voice   it is not necessary for me to tell you what is my policy  for it is your policy also .', 'our belief has been slandered  it has been disfigured  it has been utterly confused and concealed  but it has never been altered .', 'those who talk about anarchism and its dangers go

mountainous slanders which are heaped upon our heads from one end of europe to another .', 'the man who has always heard that we are walking plagues has never heard our reply .', 'i know that he will not hear it tonight  though my passion were to rend the roof .', 'for it is deep  deep under the earth that the persecuted are permitted to assemble  as the christians assembled in the catacombs .',

are only repeating that still mysterious paradox of history .', 'suppose we seem as shocking as the christians because we are really as harmless as the christians .', 'suppose we seem as mad as the christians because we are really as meek .', 'the applause that had greeted the opening sentences had been gradually growing fainter  and at the last word it stopped suddenly .', 'in the abrupt silence  the man with the velvet jacket said  in a high  squeaky voice ', ' i  m not meek ', ' comrade witherspoon tells us  resumed gregory   that he is not meek .', 'ah  how little he knows himself

human society  we shall pursue with moral courage and quiet intellectual pressure  the permanent ideals of brotherhood and simplicity .', 'gregory resumed his seat and passed his hand across his forehead .', 'the silence was sudden and awkward  but the chairman rose like an automaton  and said in a colourless voice ', ' does anyone oppose the election of comrade gregory ', 'the assembly seemed vague and sub  consciously disappointed  and comrade witherspoon moved restlessly on his seat and muttered in his thick beard .', 'by the sheer rush of routine  however  the motion would have been put and carried .', 'but as the chairman was opening his mouth to put it  syme sprang to his feet and said in a small and quiet voice ', ' yes  mr . chairman  i oppose .', 'the most effective fact in oratory is an unexpected change in the voice .', 'mr . gabriel syme evidently understood oratory .', 'having said these first formal words in a moderated tone and with a brief simplicity  he made his next word ring and volley in the vault as if one of the guns had gone off .', ' comrades ', 'he cried  in a voice that made every man jump out of his boots   have we come here for this ', 'do we live underground like rats in order to listen to talk like this ', 'this is talk we might listen to while eating buns at a sunday school treat .', 'do we line these walls with weapons and bar that

and its most pitiless enemy  hear  hear .', 'comrade gregory has told us  apologetically again  that we are not murderers .', 'there i agree .', 'we are not murderers  we are executioners  cheers .', 'ever since syme had risen gregory had sat staring at him  his face idiotic with astonishment .', 'now in the pause his lips of clay parted  and he said  with an automatic and lifeless distinctness ',

given himself to anarchy has forgotten modesty as much as he has forgotten pride  cheers .', 'i am not a man at all .', 'i am a cause  renewed cheers .', 'i set myself against comrade gregory as impersonally and as calmly as i should choose one pistol rather than another out of that rack upon the wall  and i say that rather than have gregory and his milk  and  water methods on the supreme council  i would offer myself for election ', 'his sentence was drowned in a deafening cataract of applause .', 'the faces  that had grown fiercer and fiercer with approval as his tirade grew more and more uncompromising  were now distorted with grins of anticipation or cloven with delighted cries .', 'at the moment when he announced himself as ready to stand for the post of thursday  a roar of excitement and assent broke forth  and became uncontrollable  and at the same moment gregory sprang to his feet  with foam upon his mouth  and shouted against the shouting .', ' stop  you blasted madmen ', 'he cried  at the top of a voice that tore his throat .', ' stop  you ', 'but louder than gregory  s shouting and louder than the roar of the room came the voice of syme  still speaking in a

his feet  his hair and beard all on end  and had said ', ' i move  as an amendment  that comrade syme be appointed to the post .', ' stop all this  i tell you ', 'cried gregory  with frantic face and hands .', ' stop it  it is all ', 'the voice of the chairman clove his speech with a cold accent .', ' does anyone second this amendment ', 'he said .', 'a tall  tired man  with melancholy eyes and an american chin beard  was observed on the back bench to be slowly rising to his feet .', 'gregory had been screaming for some time past  now there was a change in his accent  more shocking than any scream .', ' i end all this ', 'he said  in a voice as heavy as stone .', ' this man cannot be elected .', 'he is a ', ' yes  said syme  quite motionless   what is he ', 'gregory  s mouth worked twice without sound  then slowly the blood began to crawl back into his dead face .', ' he is a man quite inexperienced in our work  he said  and sat down abruptly .', 'before he had done so  the long  lean man with the american beard was again upon his feet  and was repeating in a high american monotone ', ' i beg to second the election of comrade syme .', ' the amendment will  as usual  be put first

not a madman .', ' oh  oh ', 'said mr . witherspoon .', ' i am not a madman  reiterated gregory  with a frightful sincerity which for a moment staggered the room   but i give you a counsel which you can call mad if you like .', 'no  i will not call it a counsel  for i can give you no reason for it .', 'i will call it a command .', 'call it a mad command  but act upon it .', 'strike  but hear me ', 'kill me  but obey me ', 'do not elect this man .', 'truth is so terrible  even in fetters  that for a moment syme  s slender and insane victory swayed like a reed .', 'but you could not have guessed it from syme  s bleak blue eyes .', 'he merely began ', ' comrade gregory commands ', 'then the spell was snapped  and one anarchist called out to gregory ', ' who are you ', 'you are not

implore you .', 'do not elect this man .', ' comrade gregory  said the chairman after a painful pause   this is really not quite dignified .', 'for the first time in the proceedings there was for a few seconds a real silence .', 'then gregory fell back in his seat  a pale wreck of a man  and the chairman repeated  like a piece of clock  work suddenly started again ', ' the question is that comrade syme be elected to the post of thursday on the general council .', 'the roar rose like the sea  the hands rose like a forest  and three minutes afterwards mr . gabriel syme  of the secret police service  was elected to the post of thursday on the general council of the anarchists of europe .', 'everyone in the room seemed to feel the tug waiting on the river  the sword  stick and the revolver  waiting on the table .', 'the instant the election was ended and irrevocable  and syme had received the paper proving his election  they all sprang to their feet  and the fiery groups moved and mixed in the room .', 'syme found himself  somehow or other  face to face with gregory  who still regarded him with a stare of stunned hatred .', 'they were silent for many minutes .', ' you are a devil ', 'said gregory at last .', ' and you are a gentleman  said syme with gravity .', ' it was you that entrapped me  began gregory  shaking from head to foot   entrapped me into ', ' talk sense  said syme shortly .', ' into what sort of devils  parliament have you entrapped me  if it comes to that ', 'you made me swear before i made you .', 'perhaps we are both doing what we think right .', 'but what we think right is so damned different that there can be nothing between us in the way of concession .', 'there is nothing possible between us but honour and death  and he pulled the great cloak about his shoulders and picked up the flask from the table .', ' the boat is quite ready  said mr . buttons  bustling up .', ' be good enough to step this way .', 'with a gesture that revealed the shop  walker  he led syme down a short  iron  bound passage  the still agonised gregory following feverishly at their heels .', 'at the end of the passage was a door  which buttons opened sharply  showing a sudden blue and silver picture of the moonlit river  that looked like a scene in a theatre .', 'close to the opening lay a dark  dwarfish steam  launch  like a baby dragon with one red eye .', 'almost in the act of stepping on board  gabriel syme turned to the gaping gregory .', ' you have kept your word  he said gently  with his face in shadow .', ' you are a man of honour  and i thank you .', 'you have kept it even down to a small particular .', 'there was one special thing you promised me at the beginning of the affair  and which you have certainly given me by the end of it .', ' what do you mean ', 'cried the chaotic gregory .', ' what did i promise you ', ' a very entertaining evening  said syme  and he made a military salute with the sword  stick as the steamboat slid away .', 'chapter iv', 'the tale of a detective', 'gabriel syme was not merely a detective who pretended to be a poet  he was really a poet who had become a detective .', 'nor was his hatred of anarchy hypocritical .', 'he was one of those who are driven early in life into too conservative an attitude by the bewildering folly of most revolutionists .', 'he had not attained it by any tame tradition .', 'his respectability was spontaneous and sudden  a rebellion against rebellion .', 'he came of a family of cranks  in which all the oldest people had all the newest notions .', 'one of his uncles always walked about without a hat  and another had made an unsuccessful attempt to walk about with a hat and nothing else .', 'his father cultivated art and self  realisation  his mother went in for simplicity and hygiene .', 'hence the child  during his tenderer years  was wholly unacquainted with any drink between the extremes of absinth and cocoa  of both of which he had a healthy dislike .', 'the more his mother preached a more than puritan abstinence the more did his father expand into a more than pagan latitude  and by the time the former had come to enforcing vegetarianism  the latter had pretty well reached the point of defending cannibalism .', 'being surrounded with every conceivable kind of revolt from infancy  gabriel had to revolt into something  so he revolted into the only thing left  sanity .', 'but there was just enough in him of the blood of these fanatics to make even his protest for common sense a little too fierce to be sensible .', 'his hatred of modern lawlessness had been crowned also by an accident .', 'it happened that he was walking in a side street at the instant of a dynamite outrage .', 'he had been blind and deaf for a moment  and then seen  the smoke clearing  the broken windows and the bleeding faces .', 'after that he went about as usual  quiet  courteous  rather gentle  but there was a spot on his mind that was not sane .', 'he did not regard anarchists  as most of us do  as a handful of morbid men  combining ignorance with intellectualism .', 'he regarded them as a huge and pitiless peril  like a chinese invasion .', 'he poured perpetually into newspapers and their waste  paper baskets a torrent of tales  verses and violent articles  warning men of this deluge of barbaric denial .', 'but he seemed to be getting no nearer his enemy  and  what was worse  no nearer a living .', 'as he paced the thames embankment  bitterly biting a cheap cigar and brooding on the advance of anarchy  there was no anarchist with a bomb in his pocket so savage or so solitary as he .', 'indeed  he always felt that government stood alone and desperate  with its back to the wall .', 'he was too quixotic to have cared for it otherwise .', 'he walked on the embankment once under a dark red sunset .', 'the red river reflected the red sky  and they both reflected his anger .', 'the sky  indeed  was so swarthy  and the light on the river relatively so lurid  that the water almost seemed of fiercer flame than the sunset it mirrored .', 'it looked like a stream of literal fire winding under the vast caverns of a subterranean country .', 'syme was shabby in those days .', 'he wore an old  fashioned black chimney  pot hat  he was wrapped in a yet more old  fashioned cloak  black and ragged  and the combination gave him the look of the early villains in dickens and bulwer lytton .', 'also his yellow beard and hair were more unkempt and leonine than when they appeared long afterwards  cut and pointed  on the lawns of saffron park .', 'a long  lean  black cigar  bought in soho for twopence  stood out from between his tightened teeth  and altogether he looked a very satisfactory specimen of the anarchists upon whom he had vowed a holy war .', 'perhaps this was why a policeman on the embankment spoke to him  and said  good evening .', 'syme  at a crisis of his morbid fears for humanity  seemed stung by the mere stolidity of the automatic official  a mere bulk of blue in the twilight .', ' a good evening is it ', 'he said sharply .', ' you fellows would call the end of the world a good evening .', 'look at that bloody red sun and that bloody river ', 'i tell you that if that were literally human blood  spilt and shining  you would still be standing here as solid as ever  looking out for some poor harmless tramp whom you could move on .', 'you policemen are cruel to the poor  but i could forgive you even your cruelty if it were not for your calm .', ' if we are calm  replied the policeman   it is the calm of organised resistance .', ' eh ', 'said syme  staring .', ' the soldier must be calm in the thick of the battle  pursued the policeman .', ' the composure of an army is the anger of a nation .', ' good god  the board schools ', 'said syme .', ' is this undenominational education ', ' no  said the policeman sadly   i never had any of those advantages .', 'the board schools came after my time .', 'what education i had was very rough and old  fashioned  i am afraid .', ' where did you have it ', 'asked syme  wondering .', ' oh  at harrow  said the policeman', 'the class sympathies which  false as they are  are the truest things in so many men  broke out of syme before he could control them .', ' but  good lord  man  he said   you oughtn  t to be a policeman ', 'the policeman sighed and shook his head .', ' i know  he said solemnly   i know i am not worthy .', ' but why did you join the police ', 'asked syme with rude curiosity .', ' for much the same reason that you abused the police  replied the other .', ' i found that there was a special opening in the service for those whose fears for humanity were concerned rather with the aberrations of the scientific intellect than with the normal and excusable  though excessive  outbreaks of the human will .', 'i trust i make myself clear .', ' if you mean that you make your opinion clear  said syme   i suppose you do .', 'but as for making yourself clear  it is the last thing you do .', 'how comes a man like you to be talking philosophy in a blue helmet on the thames embankment ', ' you have evidently not heard of the latest development in our police system  replied the other .', ' i am not surprised at it .', 'we are keeping it rather dark from the educated class  because that class contains most of our enemies .', 'but you seem to be exactly in the right frame of mind .', 'i think you might almost join us .', ' join you in what ', 'asked syme .', ' i will tell you  said the policeman slowly .', ' this is the situation  the head of one of our departments  one of the most celebrated detectives in europe  has long been of opinion that a purely intellectual conspiracy would soon threaten the very existence of civilisation .', 'he is certain that the scientific and artistic worlds are silently bound in a crusade against the family and the state .', 'he has  therefore  formed a special corps of policemen  policemen who are also philosophers .', 'it is their business to watch the beginnings of this conspiracy  not merely in a criminal but in a controversial sense .', 'i am a democrat myself  and i am fully aware of the value of the ordinary man in matters of ordinary valour or virtue .', 'but it would obviously be undesirable to employ the common policeman in an investigation which is also a heresy hunt .', 'syme  s eyes were bright with a sympathetic curiosity .', ' what do you do  then ', 'he said .', ' the work of the philosophical policeman  replied the man in blue   is at once bolder and more subtle than that of the ordinary detective .', 'the ordinary detective goes to pot  houses to arrest thieves  we go to artistic tea  parties to detect pessimists .', 'the ordinary detective discovers from a ledger or a diary that a crime has been committed .', 'we discover from a book of sonnets that a crime will be committed .', 'we have to trace the origin of those dreadful thoughts that drive men on at last to intellectual fanaticism and intellectual crime .', 'we were only just in time to prevent the assassination at hartle pool  and that was entirely due to the fact that our mr . wilks  a smart young fellow  thoroughly understood a triolet .', ' do you mean  asked syme   that there is really as much connection between crime and the modern intellect as all that ', ' you are not sufficiently democratic  answered the policeman   but you were right when you said just now that our ordinary treatment of the poor criminal was a pretty brutal business .', 'i tell you i am sometimes sick of my trade when i see how perpetually it means merely a war upon the ignorant and the desperate .', 'but this new movement of ours is a very different affair .', 'we deny the snobbish english assumption that the uneducated are the dangerous criminals .', 'we remember the roman emperors .', 'we remember the great poisoning princes of the renaissance .', 'we say that the dangerous criminal is the educated criminal .', 'we say that the most dangerous criminal now is the entirely lawless modern philosopher .', 'compared to him  burglars and bigamists are essentially moral men  my heart goes out to them .', 'they accept the essential ideal of man  they merely seek it wrongly .', 'thieves respect property .', 'they merely wish the property to become their property that they may more perfectly respect it .', 'but philosophers dislike property as property  they wish to destroy the very idea of personal possession .', 'bigamists respect marriage  or they would not go through the highly ceremonial and even ritualistic formality of bigamy .', 'but philosophers despise marriage as marriage .', 'murderers respect human life  they merely wish to attain a greater fulness of human life in themselves by the sacrifice of what seems to them to be lesser lives .', 'but philosophers hate life itself  their own as much as other people  s .', 'syme struck his hands together .', ' how true that is  he cried .', ' i have felt it from my boyhood  but never could state the verbal antithesis .', 'the common criminal is a bad man  but at least he is  as it were  a conditional good man .', 'he says that if only a certain obstacle be removed  say a wealthy uncle  he is then prepared to accept the universe and to praise god .', 'he is a reformer  but not an anarchist .', 'he wishes to cleanse the edifice  but not to destroy it .', 'but the evil philosopher is not trying to alter things  but to annihilate them .', 'yes  the modern world has retained all those parts of police work which are really oppressive and ignominious  the harrying of the poor  the spying upon the unfortunate .', 'it has given up its more dignified work  the punishment of powerful traitors the in the state and powerful heresiarchs in the church .', 'the moderns say we must not punish heretics .', 'my only doubt is whether we have a right to punish anybody else .', ' but this is absurd ', 'cried the policeman  clasping his hands with an excitement uncommon in persons of his figure and costume   but it is intolerable ', 'i don  t know what you  re doing  but you  re wasting your life .', 'you must  you shall  join our special army against anarchy .', 'their armies are on our frontiers .', 'their bolt is ready to fall .', 'a moment more  and you may lose the glory of working with us  perhaps the glory of dying with the last heroes of the world .', ' it is a chance not to be missed  certainly  assented syme   but still i do not quite understand .', 'i know as well as anybody that the modern world is full of lawless little men and mad little movements .', 'but  beastly as they are  they generally have the one merit of disagreeing with each other .', 'how can you talk of their leading one army or hurling one bolt .', 'what is this anarchy ', ' do not confuse it  replied the constable   with those chance dynamite outbreaks from russia or from ireland  which are really the outbreaks of oppressed  if mistaken  men .', 'this is a vast philosophic movement  consisting of an outer and an inner ring .', 'you might even call the outer ring the laity and the inner ring the priesthood .', 'i prefer to call the outer ring the innocent section  the inner ring the supremely guilty section .', 'the outer ring  the main mass of their supporters  are merely anarchists  that is  men who believe that rules and formulas have destroyed human happiness .', 'they believe that all the evil results of human crime are the results of the system that has called it crime .', 'they do not believe that the crime creates the punishment .', 'they believe that the punishment has created the crime .', 'they believe that if a man seduced seven women he would naturally walk away as blameless as the flowers of spring .', 'they believe that if a man picked a pocket he would naturally feel exquisitely good .', 'these i call the innocent section .', ' oh ', 'said syme .', ' naturally  therefore  these people talk about  a happy time coming   the paradise of the future   mankind freed from the bondage of vice and the bondage of virtue  and so on .', 'and so also the men of the inner circle speak  the sacred priesthood .', 'they also speak to applauding crowds of the happiness of the future  and of mankind freed at last .', 'but in their mouths  and the policeman lowered his voice  in their mouths these happy phrases have a horrible meaning .', 'they are under no illusions  they are too intellectual to think that man upon this earth can ever be quite free of original sin and the struggle .', 'and they mean death .', 'when they say that mankind shall be free at last  they mean that mankind shall commit suicide .', 'when they talk of a paradise without right or wrong  they mean the grave .', 'they have but two objects  to destroy first humanity and then themselves .', 'that is why they throw bombs instead of firing pistols .', 'the innocent rank and file are disappointed because the bomb has not killed the king  but the high  priesthood are happy because it has killed somebody .', ' how can i join you ', 'asked syme  with a sort of passion .', ' i know for a fact that there is a vacancy at the moment  said the policeman   as i have the honour to be somewhat in the confidence of the chief of whom i have spoken .', 'you should really come and see him .', 'or rather  i should not say see him  nobody ever sees him  but you can talk to him if you like .', ' telephone ', 'inquired syme  with interest .', ' no  said the policeman placidly   he has a fancy for always sitting in a pitch  dark room .', 'he says it makes his thoughts brighter .', 'do come along .', 'somewhat dazed and considerably excited  syme allowed himself to be led to a side  door in the long row of buildings of scotland yard .', 'almost before he knew what he was doing  he had been passed through the hands of about four intermediate officials  and was suddenly shown into a room  the abrupt blackness of which startled him like a blaze of light .', 'it was not the ordinary darkness  in which forms can be faintly traced  it was like going suddenly stone  blind .', ' are you the new recruit ', 'asked a heavy voice .', 'and in some strange way  though there was not the shadow of a shape in the gloom  syme knew two things  first  that it came from a man of massive stature  and second  that the man had his back to him .', ' are you the new recruit ', 'said the invisible chief  who seemed to have heard all about it .', ' all right .', 'you are engaged .', 'syme  quite swept off his feet  made a feeble fight against this irrevocable phrase .', ' i really have no experience  he began .', ' no one has any experience  said the other   of the battle of armageddon .', ' but i am really unfit ', ' you are willing  that is enough  said the unknown .', ' well  really  said syme   i don  t know any profession of which mere willingness is the final test .', ' i do  said the other  martyrs .', 'i am condemning you to death .', 'good day .', 'thus it was that when gabriel syme came out again into the crimson light of evening  in his shabby black hat and shabby  lawless cloak  he came out a member of the new detective corps for the frustration of the great conspiracy .', 'acting under the advice of his friend the policeman  who was professionally inclined to neatness  he trimmed his hair and beard  bought a good hat  clad himself in an exquisite summer suit of light blue  grey  with a pale yellow flower in the button  hole  and  in short  became that elegant and rather insupportable person whom gregory had first encountered in the little garden of saffron park .', 'before he finally left the police premises his friend provided him with a small blue card  on which was written   the last crusade  and a number  the sign of his official authority .', 'he put this carefully in his upper waistcoat pocket  lit a cigarette  and went forth to track and fight the enemy in all the drawing  rooms of london .', 'where his adventure ultimately led him we have already seen .', 'at about half  past one on a february night he found himself steaming in a small tug up the silent thames  armed with swordstick and revolver  the duly elected thursday of the central council of anarchists .', 'when syme stepped out on to the steam  tug he had a singular sensation of stepping out into something entirely new  not merely into the landscape of a new land  but even into the landscape of a new planet .', 'this was mainly due to the insane yet solid decision of that evening  though partly also to an entire change in the weather and the sky since he entered the little tavern some two hours before .', 'every trace of the passionate plumage of the cloudy sunset had been swept away  and a naked moon stood in a naked sky .', 'the moon was so strong and full that  by a paradox often to be noticed  it seemed like a weaker sun .', 'it gave  not the sense of bright moonshine  but rather of a dead daylight .', 'over the whole landscape lay a luminous and unnatural discoloration  as of that disastrous twilight which milton spoke of as shed by the sun in eclipse  so that syme fell easily into his first thought  that he was actually on some other and emptier planet  which circled round some sadder star .', 'but the more he felt this glittering desolation in the moonlit land  the more his own chivalric folly glowed in the night like a great fire .', 'even the common things he carried with him  the food and the brandy and the loaded pistol  took on exactly that concrete and material poetry which a child feels when he takes a gun upon a journey or a bun with him to bed .', 'the sword  stick and the brandy  flask  though in themselves only the tools of morbid conspirators  became the expressions of his own more healthy romance .', 'the sword  stick became almost the sword of chivalry  and the brandy the wine of the stirrup  cup .', 'for even the most dehumanised modern fantasies depend on some older and simpler figure  the adventures may be mad  but the adventurer must be sane .', 'the dragon without st . george would not even be grotesque .', 'so this inhuman landscape was only imaginative by the presence of a man really human .', 'to syme  s exaggerative mind the bright  bleak houses and terraces by the thames looked as empty as the mountains of the moon .', 'but even the moon is only poetical because there is a man in the moon .', 'the tug was worked by two men  and with much toil went comparatively slowly .', 'the clear moon that had lit up chiswick had gone down by the time that they passed battersea  and when they came under the enormous bulk of westminster day had already begun to break .', 'it broke like the splitting of great bars of lead  showing bars of silver  and these had brightened like white fire when the tug  changing its onward course  turned inward to a large landing stage rather beyond charing cross .', 'the great stones of the embankment seemed equally dark and gigantic as syme looked up at them .', 'they were big and black against the huge white dawn .', 'they made him feel that he was landing on the colossal steps of some egyptian palace  and  indeed  the thing suited his mood  for he was  in his own mind  mounting to attack the solid thrones of horrible and heathen kings .', 'he leapt out of the boat on to one slimy step  and stood  a dark and slender figure  amid the enormous masonry .', 'the two men in the tug put her off again and turned up stream .', 'they had never spoken a word .', 'chapter v', 'the feast of fear', 'at first the large stone stair seemed to syme as deserted as a pyramid  but before he reached the top he had realised that there was a man leaning over the parapet of the embankment and looking out across the river .', 'as a figure he was quite conventional  clad in a silk hat and frock  coat of the more formal type of fashion  he had a red flower in his buttonhole .', 'as syme drew nearer to him step by step  he did not even move a hair  and syme could come close enough to notice even in the dim  pale morning light that his face was long  pale and intellectual  and ended in a small triangular tuft of dark beard at the very point of the chin  all else being clean  shaven .', 'this scrap of hair almost seemed a mere oversight  the rest of the face was of the type that is best shaven  clear  cut  ascetic  and in its way noble .', 'syme drew closer and closer  noting all this  and still the figure did not stir .', 'at first an instinct had told syme that this was the man whom he was meant to meet .', 'then  seeing that the man made no sign  he had concluded that he was not .', 'and now again he had come back to a certainty that the man had something to do with his mad adventure .', 'for the man remained more still than would have been natural if a stranger had come so close .', 'he was as motionless as a wax  work  and got on the nerves somewhat in the same way .', 'syme looked again and again at the pale  dignified and delicate face  and the face still looked blankly across the river .', 'then he took out of his pocket the note from buttons proving his election  and put it before that sad and beautiful face .', 'then the man smiled  and his smile was a shock  for it was all on one side  going up in the right cheek and down in the left .', 'there was nothing  rationally speaking  to scare anyone about this .', 'many people have this nervous trick of a crooked smile  and in many it is even attractive .', 'but in all syme  s circumstances  with the dark dawn and the deadly errand and the loneliness on the great dripping stones  there was something unnerving in it .', 'there was the silent river and the silent man  a man of even classic face .', 'and there was the last nightmare touch that his smile suddenly went wrong .', 'the spasm of smile was instantaneous  and the man  s face dropped at once into its harmonious melancholy .', 'he spoke without further explanation or inquiry  like a man speaking to an old colleague .', ' if we walk up towards leicester square  he said   we shall just be in time for breakfast .', 'sunday always insists on an early breakfast .', 'have you had any sleep ', ' no  said syme .', ' nor have i  answered the man in an ordinary tone .', ' i shall try to get to bed after breakfast .', 'he spoke with casual civility  but in an utterly dead voice that contradicted the fanaticism of his face .', 'it seemed almost as if all friendly words were to him lifeless conveniences  and that his only life was hate .', 'after a pause the man spoke again .', ' of course  the secretary of the branch told you everything that can be told .', 'but the one thing that can never be told is the last notion of the president  for his notions grow like a tropical forest .', 'so in case you don  t know  i  d better tell you that he is carrying out his notion of concealing ourselves by not concealing ourselves to the most extraordinary lengths just now .', 'originally  of course  we met in a cell underground  just as your branch does .', 'then sunday made us take a private room at an ordinary restaurant .', 'he said that if you didn  t seem to be hiding nobody hunted you out .', 'well  he is the only man on earth  i know  but sometimes i really think that his huge brain is going a little mad in its old age .', 'for now we flaunt ourselves before the public .', 'we have our breakfast on a balcony  on a balcony  if you please  overlooking leicester square .', ' and what do the people say ', 'asked syme .', ' it  s quite simple what they say  answered his guide .', ' they say we are a lot of jolly gentlemen who pretend they are anarchists .', ' it seems to me a very clever idea  said syme .', ' clever ', 'god blast your impudence ', 'clever ', 'cried out the other in a sudden  shrill voice which was as startling and discordant as his crooked smile .', ' when you  ve seen sunday for a split second you  ll leave off calling him clever .', 'with this they emerged out of a narrow street  and saw the early sunlight filling leicester square .', 'it will never be known  i suppose  why this square itself should look so alien and in some ways so continental .', 'it will never be known whether it was the foreign look that attracted the foreigners or the foreigners who gave it the foreign look .', 'but on this particular morning the effect seemed singularly bright and clear .', 'between the open square and the sunlit leaves and the statue and the saracenic outlines of the alhambra  it looked the replica of some french or even spanish public place .', 'and this effect increased in syme the sensation  which in many shapes he had had through the whole adventure  the eerie sensation of having strayed into a new world .', 'as a fact  he had bought bad cigars round leicester square ever since he was a boy .', 'but as he turned that corner  and saw the trees and the moorish cupolas  he could have sworn that he was turning into an unknown place de something or other in some foreign town .', 'at one corner of the square there projected a kind of angle of a prosperous but quiet hotel  the bulk of which belonged to a street behind .', 'in the wall there was one large french window  probably the window of a large coffee  room  and outside this window  almost literally overhanging the square  was a formidably buttressed balcony  big enough to contain a dining  table .', 'in fact  it did contain a dining  table  or more strictly a breakfast  table  and round the breakfast  table  glowing in the sunlight and evident to the street  were a group of noisy and talkative men  all dressed in the insolence of fashion  with white waistcoats and expensive button  holes .', 'some of their jokes could almost be heard across the square .', 'then the grave secretary gave his unnatural smile  and syme knew that this boisterous breakfast party was the secret conclave of the european dynamiters .', 'then  as syme continued to stare at them  he saw something that he had not seen before .', 'he had not seen it literally because it was too large to see .', 'at the nearest end of the balcony  blocking up a great part of the perspective  was the back of a great mountain of a man .', 'when syme had seen him  his first thought was that the weight of him must break down the balcony of stone .', 'his vastness did not lie only in the fact that he was abnormally tall and quite incredibly fat .', 'this man was planned enormously in his original proportions  like a statue carved deliberately as colossal .', 'his head  crowned with white hair  as seen from behind looked bigger than a head ought to be .', 'the ears that stood out from it looked larger than human ears .', 'he was enlarged terribly to scale  and this sense of size was so staggering  that when syme saw him all the other figures seemed quite suddenly to dwindle and become dwarfish .', 'they were still sitting there as before with their flowers and frock  coats  but now it looked as if the big man was entertaining five children to tea .', 'as syme and the guide approached the side door of the hotel  a waiter came out smiling with every tooth in his head .', ' the gentlemen are up there  sare  he said .', ' they do talk and they do laugh at what they talk .', 'they do say they will throw bombs at ze king .', 'and the waiter hurried away with a napkin over his arm  much pleased with the singular frivolity of the gentlemen upstairs .', 'the two men mounted the stairs in silence .', 'syme had never thought of asking whether the monstrous man who almost filled and broke the balcony was the great president of whom the others stood in awe .', 'he knew it was so  with an unaccountable but instantaneous certainty .', 'syme  indeed  was one of those men who are open to all the more nameless psychological influences in a degree a little dangerous to mental health .', 'utterly devoid of fear in physical dangers  he was a great deal too sensitive to the smell of spiritual evil .', 'twice already that night little unmeaning things had peeped out at him almost pruriently  and given him a sense of drawing nearer and nearer to the head  quarters of hell .', 'and this sense became overpowering as he drew nearer to the great president .', 'the form it took was a childish and yet hateful fancy .', 'as he walked across the inner room towards the balcony  the large face of sunday grew larger and larger  and syme was gripped with a fear that when he was quite close the face would be too big to be possible  and that he would scream aloud .', 'he remembered that as a child he would not look at the mask of memnon in the british museum  because it was a face  and so large .', 'by an effort  braver than that of leaping over a cliff  he went to an empty seat at the breakfast  table and sat down .', 'the men greeted him with good  humoured raillery as if they had always known him .', 'he sobered himself a little by looking at their conventional coats and solid  shining coffee  pot  then he looked again at sunday .', 'his face was very large  but it was still possible to humanity .', 'in the presence of the president the whole company looked sufficiently commonplace  nothing about them caught the eye at first  except that by the president  s caprice they had been dressed up with a festive respectability  which gave the meal the look of a wedding breakfast .', 'one man indeed stood out at even a superficial glance .', 'he at least was the common or garden dynamiter .', 'he wore  indeed  the high white collar and satin tie that were the uniform of the occasion  but out of this collar there sprang a head quite unmanageable and quite unmistakable  a bewildering bush of brown hair and beard that almost obscured the eyes like those of a skye terrier .', 'but the eyes did look out of the tangle  and they were the sad eyes of some russian serf .', 'the effect of this figure was not terrible like that of the president  but it had every diablerie that can come from the utterly grotesque .', 'if out of that stiff tie and collar there had come abruptly the head of a cat or a dog  it could not have been a more idiotic contrast .', 'the man  s name  it seemed  was gogol  he was a pole  and in this circle of days he was called tuesday .', 'his soul and speech were incurably tragic  he could not force himself to play the prosperous and frivolous part demanded of him by president sunday .', 'and  indeed  when syme came in the president  with that daring disregard of public suspicion which was his policy  was actually chaffing gogol upon his inability to assume conventional graces .', ' our friend tuesday  said the president in a deep voice at once of quietude and volume   our friend tuesday doesn  t seem to grasp the idea .', 'he dresses up like a gentleman  but he seems to be too great a soul to behave like one .', 'he insists on the ways of the stage conspirator .', 'now if a gentleman goes about london in a top hat and a frock  coat  no one need know that he is an anarchist .', 'but if a gentleman puts on a top hat and a frock  coat  and then goes about on his hands and knees  well  he may attract attention .', 'that  s what brother gogol does .', 'he goes about on his hands and knees with such inexhaustible diplomacy  that by this time he finds it quite difficult to walk upright .', ' i am not good at goncealment  said gogol sulkily  with a thick foreign accent   i am not ashamed of the cause .', ' yes you are  my boy  and so is the cause of you  said the president good  naturedly .', ' you hide as much as anybody  but you can  t do it  you see  you  re such an ass ', 'you try to combine two inconsistent methods .', 'when a householder finds a man under his bed  he will probably pause to note the circumstance .', 'but if he finds a man under his bed in a top hat  you will agree with me  my dear tuesday  that he is not likely even to forget it .', 'now when you were found under admiral biffin  s bed ', ' i am not good at deception  said tuesday gloomily  flushing .', ' right  my boy  right  said the president with a ponderous heartiness   you aren  t good at anything .', 'while this stream of conversation continued  syme was looking more steadily at the men around him .', 'as he did so  he gradually felt all his sense of something spiritually queer return .', 'he had thought at first that they were all of common stature and costume  with the evident exception of the hairy gogol .', 'but as he looked at the others  he began to see in each of them exactly what he had seen in the man by the river  a demoniac detail somewhere .', 'that lop  sided laugh  which would suddenly disfigure the fine face of his original guide  was typical of all these types .', 'each man had something about him  perceived perhaps at the tenth or twentieth glance  which was not normal  and which seemed hardly human .', 'the only metaphor he could think of was this  that they all looked as men of fashion and presence would look  with the additional twist given in a false and curved mirror .', 'only the individual examples will express this half  concealed eccentricity .', 'syme  s original cicerone bore the title of monday  he was the secretary of the council  and his twisted smile was regarded with more terror than anything  except the president  s horrible  happy laughter .', 'but now that syme had more space and light to observe him  there were other touches .', 'his fine face was so emaciated  that syme thought it must be wasted with some disease  yet somehow the very distress of his dark eyes denied this .', 'it was no physical ill that troubled him .', 'his eyes were alive with intellectual torture  as if pure thought was pain .', 'he was typical of each of the tribe  each man was subtly and differently wrong .', 'next to him sat tuesday  the tousle  headed gogol  a man more obviously mad .', 'next was wednesday  a certain marquis de st . eustache  a sufficiently characteristic figure .', 'the first few glances found nothing unusual about him  except that he was the only man at table who wore the fashionable clothes as if they were really his own .', 'he had a black french beard cut square and a black english frock  coat cut even squarer .', 'but syme  sensitive to such things  felt somehow that the man carried a rich atmosphere with him  a rich atmosphere that suffocated .', 'it reminded one irrationally of drowsy odours and of dying lamps in the darker poems of byron and poe .', 'with this went a sense of his being clad  not in lighter colours  but in softer materials  his black seemed richer and warmer than the black shades about him  as if it were compounded of profound colour .', 'his black coat looked as if it were only black by being too dense a purple .', 'his black beard looked as if it were only black by being too deep a blue .', 'and in the gloom and thickness of the beard his dark red mouth showed sensual and scornful .', 'whatever he was he was not a frenchman  he might be a jew  he might be something deeper yet in the dark heart of the east .', 'in the bright coloured persian tiles and pictures showing tyrants hunting  you may see just those almond eyes  those blue  black beards  those cruel  crimson lips .', 'then came syme  and next a very old man  professor de worms  who still kept the chair of friday  though every day it was expected that his death would leave it empty .', 'save for his intellect  he was in the last dissolution of senile decay .', 'his face was as grey as his long grey beard  his forehead was lifted and fixed finally in a furrow of mild despair .', 'in no other case  not even that of gogol  did the bridegroom brilliancy of the morning dress express a more painful contrast .', 'for the red flower in his button  hole showed up against a face that was literally discoloured like lead  the whole hideous effect was as if some drunken dandies had put their clothes upon a corpse .', 'when he rose or sat down  which was with long labour and peril  something worse was expressed than mere weakness  something indefinably connected with the horror of the whole scene .', 'it did not express decrepitude merely  but corruption .', 'another hateful fancy crossed syme  s quivering mind .', 'he could not help thinking that whenever the man moved a leg or arm might fall off .', 'right at the end sat the man called saturday  the simplest and the most baffling of all .', 'he was a short  square man with a dark  square face clean  shaven  a medical practitioner going by the name of bull .', 'he had that combination of savoir  faire with a sort of well  groomed coarseness which is not uncommon in young doctors .', 'he carried his fine clothes with confidence rather than ease  and he mostly wore a set smile .', 'there was nothing whatever odd about him  except that he wore a pair of dark  almost opaque spectacles .', 'it may have been merely a crescendo of nervous fancy that had gone before  but those black discs were dreadful to syme  they reminded him of half  remembered ugly tales  of some story about pennies being put on the eyes of the dead .', 'syme  s eye always caught the black glasses and the blind grin .', 'had the dying professor worn them  or even the pale secretary  they would have been appropriate .', 'but on the younger and grosser man they seemed only an enigma .', 'they took away the key of the face .', 'you could not tell what his smile or his gravity meant .', 'partly from this  and partly because he had a vulgar virility wanting in most of the others it seemed to syme that he might be the wickedest of all those wicked men .', 'syme even had the thought that his eyes might be covered up because they were too frightful to see .', 'chapter vi', 'the exposure', 'such were the six men who had sworn to destroy the world .', 'again and again syme strove to pull together his common sense in their presence .', 'sometimes he saw for an instant that these notions were subjective  that he was only looking at ordinary men  one of whom was old  another nervous  another short  sighted .', 'the sense of an unnatural symbolism always settled back on him again .', 'each figure seemed to be  somehow  on the borderland of things  just as their theory was on the borderland of thought .', 'he knew that each one of these men stood at the extreme end  so to speak  of some wild road of reasoning .', 'he could only fancy  as in some old  world fable  that if a man went westward to the end of the world he would find something  say a tree  that was more or less than a tree  a tree possessed by a spirit  and that if he went east to the end of the world he would find something else that was not wholly itself  a tower  perhaps  of which the very shape was wicked .', 'so these figures seemed to stand up  violent and unaccountable  against an ultimate horizon  visions from the verge .', 'the ends of the earth were closing in .', 'talk had been going on steadily as he took in the scene  and not the least of the contrasts of that bewildering breakfast  table was the contrast between the easy and unobtrusive tone of talk and its terrible purport .', 'they were deep in the discussion of an actual and immediate plot .', 'the waiter downstairs had spoken quite correctly when he said that they were talking about bombs and kings .', 'only three days afterwards the czar was to meet the president of the french republic in paris  and over their bacon and eggs upon their sunny balcony these beaming gentlemen had decided how both should die .', 'even the instrument was chosen  the black  bearded marquis  it appeared  was to carry the bomb .', 'ordinarily speaking  the proximity of this positive and objective crime would have sobered syme  and cured him of all his merely mystical tremors .', 'he would have thought of nothing but the need of saving at least two human bodies from being ripped in pieces with iron and roaring gas .', 'but the truth was that by this time he had begun to feel a third kind of fear  more piercing and practical than either his moral revulsion or his social responsibility .', 'very simply  he had no fear to spare for the french president or the czar  he had begun to fear for himself .', 'most of the talkers took little heed of him  debating now with their faces closer together  and almost uniformly grave  save when for an instant the smile of the secretary ran aslant across his face as the jagged lightning runs aslant across the sky .', 'but there was one persistent thing which first troubled syme and at last terrified him .', 'the president was always looking at him  steadily  and with a great and baffling interest .', 'the enormous man was quite quiet  but his blue eyes stood out of his head .', 'and they were always fixed on syme .', 'syme felt moved to spring up and leap over the balcony .', 'when the president  s eyes were on him he felt as if he were made of glass .', 'he had hardly the shred of a doubt that in some silent and extraordinary way sunday had found out that he was a spy .', 'he looked over the edge of the balcony  and saw a policeman  standing abstractedly just beneath  staring at the bright railings and the sunlit trees .', 'then there fell upon him the great temptation that was to torment him for many days .', 'in the presence of these powerful and repulsive men  who were the princes of anarchy  he had almost forgotten the frail and fanciful figure of the poet gregory  the mere aesthete of anarchism .', 'he even thought of him now with an old kindness  as if they had played together when children .', 'but he remembered that he was still tied to gregory by a great promise .', 'he had promised never to do the very thing that he now felt himself almost in the act of doing .', 'he had promised not to jump over that balcony and speak to that policeman .', 'he took his cold hand off the cold stone balustrade .', 'his soul swayed in a vertigo of moral indecision .', 'he had only to snap the thread of a rash vow made to a villainous society  and all his life could be as open and sunny as the square beneath him .', 'he had  on the other hand  only to keep his antiquated honour  and be delivered inch by inch into the power of this great enemy of mankind  whose very intellect was a torture  chamber .', 'whenever he looked down into the square he saw the comfortable policeman  a pillar of common sense and common order .', 'whenever he looked back at the breakfast  table he saw the president still quietly studying him with big  unbearable eyes .', 'in all the torrent of his thought there were two thoughts that never crossed his mind .', 'first  it never occurred to him to doubt that the president and his council could crush him if he continued to stand alone .', 'the place might be public  the project might seem impossible .', 'but sunday was not the man who would carry himself thus easily without having  somehow or somewhere  set open his iron trap .', 'either by anonymous poison or sudden street accident  by hypnotism or by fire from hell  sunday could certainly strike him .', 'if he defied the man he was probably dead  either struck stiff there in his chair or long afterwards as by an innocent ailment .', 'if he called in the police promptly  arrested everyone  told all  and set against them the whole energy of england  he would probably escape  certainly not otherwise .', 'they were a balconyful of gentlemen overlooking a bright and busy square  but he felt no more safe with them than if they had been a boatful of armed pirates overlooking an empty sea .', 'there was a second thought that never came to him .', 'it never occurred to him to be spiritually won over to the enemy .', 'many moderns  inured to a weak worship of intellect and force  might have wavered in their allegiance under this oppression of a great personality .', 'they might have called sunday the super  man .', 'if any such creature be conceivable  he looked  indeed  somewhat like it  with his earth  shaking abstraction  as of a stone statue walking .', 'he might have been called something above man  with his large plans  which were too obvious to be detected  with his large face  which was too frank to be understood .', 'but this was a kind of modern meanness to which syme could not sink even in his extreme morbidity .', 'like any man  he was coward enough to fear great force  but he was not quite coward enough to admire it .', 'the men were eating as they talked  and even in this they were typical .', 'dr . bull and the marquis ate casually and conventionally of the best things on the table  cold pheasant or strasbourg pie .', 'but the secretary was a vegetarian  and he spoke earnestly of the projected murder over half a raw tomato and three quarters of a glass of tepid water .', 'the old professor had such slops as suggested a sickening second childhood .', 'and even in this president sunday preserved his curious predominance of mere mass .', 'for he ate like twenty men  he ate incredibly  with a frightful freshness of appetite  so that it was like watching a sausage factory .', 'yet continually  when he had swallowed a dozen crumpets or drunk a quart of coffee  he would be found with his great head on one side staring at syme .', ' i have often wondered  said the marquis  taking a great bite out of a slice of bread and jam   whether it wouldn  t be better for me to do it with a knife .', 'most of the best things have been brought off with a knife .', 'and it would be a new emotion to get a knife into a french president and wriggle it round .', ' you are wrong  said the secretary  drawing his black brows together .', ' the knife was merely the expression of the old personal quarrel with a personal tyrant .', 'dynamite is not only our best tool  but our best symbol .', 'it is as perfect a symbol of us as is incense of the prayers of the christians .', 'it expands  it only destroys because it broadens  even so  thought only destroys because it broadens .', 'a man  s brain is a bomb  he cried out  loosening suddenly his strange passion and striking his own skull with violence .', ' my brain feels like a bomb  night and day .', 'it must expand ', 'it must expand ', 'a man  s brain must expand  if it breaks up the universe .', ' i don  t want the universe broken up just yet  drawled the marquis .', ' i want to do a lot of beastly things before i die .', 'i thought of one yesterday in bed .', ' no  if the only end of the thing is nothing  said dr . bull with his sphinx  like smile   it hardly seems worth doing .', 'the old professor was staring at the ceiling with dull eyes .', ' every man knows in his heart  he said   that nothing is worth doing .', 'there was a singular silence  and then the secretary said ', ' we are wandering  however  from the point .', 'the only question is how wednesday is to strike the blow .', 'i take it we should all agree with the original notion of a bomb .', 'as to the actual arrangements  i should suggest that tomorrow morning he should go first of all to ', 'the speech was broken off short under a vast shadow .', 'president sunday had risen to his feet  seeming to fill the sky above them .', ' before we discuss that  he said in a small  quiet voice   let us go into a private room .', 'i have something vent particular to say .', 'syme stood up before any of the others .', 'the instant of choice had come at last  the pistol was at his head .', 'on the pavement before he could hear the policeman idly stir and stamp  for the morning  though bright  was cold .', 'a barrel  organ in the street suddenly sprang with a jerk into a jovial tune .', 'syme stood up taut  as if it had been a bugle before the battle .', 'he found himself filled with a supernatural courage that came from nowhere .', 'that jingling music seemed full of the vivacity  the vulgarity  and the irrational valour of the poor  who in all those unclean streets were all clinging to the decencies and the charities of christendom .', 'his youthful prank of being a policeman had faded from his mind  he did not think of himself as the representative of the corps of gentlemen turned into fancy constables  or of the old eccentric who lived in the dark room .', 'but he did feel himself as the ambassador of all these common and kindly people in the street  who every day marched into battle to the music of the barrel  organ .', 'and this high pride in being human had lifted him unaccountably to an infinite height above the monstrous men around him .', 'for an instant  at least  he looked down upon all their sprawling eccentricities from the starry pinnacle of the commonplace .', 'he felt towards them all that unconscious and elementary superiority that a brave man feels over powerful beasts or a wise man over powerful errors .', 'he knew that he had neither the intellectual nor the physical strength of president sunday  but in that moment he minded it no more than the fact that he had not the muscles of a tiger or a horn on his nose like a rhinoceros .', 'all was swallowed up in an ultimate certainty that the president was wrong and that the barrel  organ was right .', 'there clanged in his mind that unanswerable and terrible truism in the song of roland ', ' pagens ont tort et chretiens ont droit .', 'which in the old nasal french has the clang and groan of great iron .', 'this liberation of his spirit from the load of his weakness went with a quite clear decision to embrace death .', 'if the people of the barrel  organ could keep their old  world obligations  so could he .', 'this very pride in keeping his word was that he was keeping it to miscreants .', 'it was his last triumph over these lunatics to go down into their dark room and die for something that they could not even understand .', 'the barrel  organ seemed to give the marching tune with the energy and the mingled noises of a whole orchestra  and he could hear deep and rolling  under all the trumpets of the pride of life  the drums of the pride of death .', 'the conspirators were already filing through the open window and into the rooms behind .', 'syme went last  outwardly calm  but with all his brain and body throbbing with romantic rhythm .', 'the president led them down an irregular side stair  such as might be used by servants  and into a dim  cold  empty room  with a table and benches  like an abandoned boardroom .', 'when they were all in  he closed and locked the door .', 'the first to speak was gogol  the irreconcilable  who seemed bursting with inarticulate grievance .', ' zso ', 'zso ', 'he cried  with an obscure excitement  his heavy polish accent becoming almost impenetrable .', ' you zay you nod  ide .', 'you zay you show himselves .', 'it is all nuzzinks .', 'ven you vant talk importance you run yourselves in a dark box ', 'the president seemed to take the foreigner  s incoherent satire with entire good humour .', ' you can  t get hold of it

of gonzealment .', 'i would zmite ze tyrant in ze open square .', ' i see  i see  said the president  nodding kindly as he seated himself at the top of a long table .', ' you die for mankind first  and then you get up and smite their oppressors .', 'so that  s all right .', 'and now may i ask you to control your beautiful sentiments  and sit down with the other gentlemen at this table .', 'for the first time this morning something intelligent is going to be said .', 'syme  with the perturbed promptitude he had shown since the original summons  sat down first .', 'gogol sat down last  grumbling in his brown beard about gombromise .', 'no one except syme seemed to have any notion of the blow that was about to fall .', 'as for him  he had merely the feeling of a man mounting the scaffold with the intention  at any rate  of making a good speech .', ' comrades  said the president  suddenly rising   we have spun out this farce long enough .', 'i have called you down here to tell you something so simple and shocking that even the waiters upstairs  long inured to our levities  might hear some new seriousness in my voice .', 'comrades  we were discussing plans and naming places .', 'i propose  before saying anything else  that those plans and places should not be voted by this meeting  but should be left wholly in the control of some one reliable member .', 'i suggest comrade saturday  dr .', 'bull .', 'they all stared at him  then they all started in their seats  for the next words  though not loud  had a living and sensational emphasis .', 'sunday struck the table .', ' not one word more about the plans and places must be said at this meeting .', 'not one tiny detail more about what we mean to do must be mentioned in this company .', 'sunday had spent his life in astonishing his followers  but it seemed as if he had never really astonished them until now .', 'they all moved feverishly in their seats  except syme .', 'he sat stiff in his  with his hand in his pocket  and on the handle of his loaded revolver .', 'when the attack on him came he would sell his life dear .', 'he would find out at least if the president was mortal .', 'sunday went on smoothly ', ' you will probably understand that there is only one possible motive for forbidding free speech at this festival of freedom .', 'strangers overhearing us matters nothing .', 'they assume that we are joking .', 'but what would matter  even unto death  is this  that there should be one actually among us who is not of us  who knows our grave purpose  but does not share it  who ', 'the secretary screamed out suddenly like a woman .', ' it can  t be ', 'he cried  leaping .', ' there can  t ', 'the president flapped his large flat hand on the table like the fin of some huge fish .', ' yes  he said slowly   there is a spy in this room .', 'there is a traitor at this table .', 'i will waste no more words .', 'his name ', 'syme half rose from his seat  his finger firm on the trigger .', ' his name is gogol  said the president .', ' he is that hairy humbug over there who pretends to be a pole .', 'gogol sprang to his feet  a pistol in each hand .', 'with the same flash three men sprang at his throat .', 'even the professor made an effort to rise .', 'but syme saw little of the scene  for he was blinded with a beneficent darkness  he had sunk down into his seat shuddering  in a palsy of passionate relief .', 'chapter vii', 'the unaccountable conduct of professor de worms', ' sit down ', 'said sunday in a voice that he used once or twice in his life  a voice that made men drop drawn swords .', 'the three who had risen fell away from gogol  and that equivocal person himself resumed his seat .', ' well  my man  said the president briskly  addressing him as one addresses a total stranger   will you oblige me by putting your hand in your upper waistcoat pocket and showing me what you have there ', 'the alleged pole was a little pale under his tangle of dark hair  but he put two fingers into the pocket with apparent coolness and pulled out a blue strip of card .', 'when syme saw it lying on the table  he woke up again to the world outside him .', 'for although the card lay at the other extreme of the table  and he could read nothing of the inscription on it  it bore a startling resemblance to the blue card in his own pocket  the card which had been given to him when he joined the anti  anarchist constabulary .', ' pathetic slav  said the president   tragic child of poland  are you prepared in the presence of that card to deny that you are in this company  shall we say de trop ', ' right oh ', 'said the late gogol .', 'it made everyone jump to hear a clear  commercial and somewhat cockney voice coming out of that forest of foreign hair .', 'it was irrational  as if a chinaman had suddenly spoken with a scotch accent .', ' i gather that you fully understand your position  said sunday .', ' you bet  answered the pole .', ' i see it  s a fair cop .', 'all i say is  i don  t believe any pole could have imitated my accent like i did his .', ' i concede the point  said sunday .', ' i believe your own accent to be inimitable  though i shall practise it in my bath .', 'do you mind leaving your beard with your card ', ' not a bit  answered gogol  and with one finger he ripped off the whole of his shaggy head  covering  emerging with thin red hair and a pale  pert face .', ' it was hot  he added .', ' i will do you the justice to say  said sunday  not without a sort of brutal admiration   that you seem to have kept pretty cool under it .', 'now listen to me .', 'i like you .', 'the consequence is that it would annoy me for just about two and a half minutes if i heard that you had died in torments .', 'well  if you ever tell the police or any human soul about us  i shall have that two and a half minutes of discomfort .', 'on your discomfort i will not dwell .', 'good day .', 'mind the step .', 'the red  haired detective who had masqueraded as gogol rose to his feet without a word  and walked out of the room with an air of perfect nonchalance .', 'yet the astonished syme was able to realise that this ease was suddenly assumed  for there was a slight stumble outside the door  which showed that the departing detective had not minded the step .', ' time is flying  said the president in his gayest manner  after glancing at his watch  which like everything about him seemed bigger than it ought to be .', ' i must go off at once  i have to take the chair at a humanitarian meeting .', 'the secretary turned to him with working eyebrows .', ' would it not be better  he said a little sharply   to discuss further the details of our project  now that the spy has left us ', ' no  i think not  said the president with a yawn like an unobtrusive earthquake .', ' leave it as it is .', 'let saturday settle it .', 'i must be off .', 'breakfast here next sunday .', 'but the late loud scenes had whipped up the almost naked nerves of the secretary .', 'he was one of those men who are conscientious even in crime .', ' i must protest  president  that the thing is irregular  he said .', ' it is a fundamental rule of our society that all plans shall be debated in full council .', 'of course  i fully appreciate your forethought when in the actual presence of a traitor ', ' secretary  said the president seriously   if you  d take your head home and boil it for a turnip it might be useful .', 'i can  t say .', 'but it might .', 'the secretary reared back in a kind of equine anger .', ' i really fail to understand  he began in high offense .', ' that  s it  that  s it  said the president  nodding a great many times .', ' that  s where you fail right enough .', 'you fail to understand .', 'why  you dancing donkey  he roared  rising   you didn  t want to be overheard by a spy  didn  t you ', 'how do you know you aren  t overheard now ', 'and with these words he shouldered his way out of the room  shaking with incomprehensible scorn .', 'four of the men left behind gaped after him without any apparent glimmering of his meaning .', 'syme alone had even a glimmering  and such as it was it froze him to the bone .', 'if the last words of the president meant anything  they meant that he had not after all passed unsuspected .', 'they meant that while sunday could not denounce him like gogol  he still could not trust him like the others .', 'the other four got to their feet grumbling more or less  and betook themselves elsewhere to find lunch  for it was already well past midday .', 'the professor went last  very slowly and painfully .', 'syme sat long after the rest had gone  revolving his strange position .', 'he had escaped a thunderbolt  but he was still under a cloud .', 'at last he rose and made his way out of the hotel into leicester square .', 'the bright  cold day had grown increasingly colder  and when he came out into the street he was surprised by a few flakes of snow .', 'while he still carried the sword  stick and the rest of gregory  s portable luggage  he had thrown the cloak down and left it somewhere  perhaps on the steam  tug  perhaps on the balcony .', 'hoping  therefore  that the snow  shower might be slight  he stepped back out of the street for a moment and stood up under the doorway of a small and greasy hair  dresser  s shop  the front window of which was empty  except for a sickly wax lady in evening dress .', 'snow  however  began to thicken and fall fast  and syme  having found one glance at the wax lady quite sufficient to depress his spirits  stared out instead into the white and empty street .', 'he was considerably astonished to see  standing quite still outside the shop and staring into the window  a man .', 'his top hat was loaded with snow like the hat of father christmas  the white drift was rising round his boots and ankles  but it seemed as if nothing could tear him away from the contemplation of the colourless wax doll in dirty evening dress .', 'that any human being should stand in such weather looking into such a shop was a matter of sufficient wonder to syme  but his idle wonder turned suddenly into a personal shock  for he realised that the man standing there was the paralytic old professor de worms .', 'it scarcely seemed the place for a person of his years and infirmities .', 'syme was ready to believe anything about the perversions of this dehumanized brotherhood  but even he could not believe that the professor had fallen in love with that particular wax lady .', 'he could only suppose that the man  s malady  whatever it was  involved some momentary fits of rigidity or trance .', 'he was not inclined  however  to feel in this case any very compassionate concern .', 'on the contrary  he rather congratulated himself that the professor  s stroke and his elaborate and limping walk would make it easy to escape from him and leave him miles behind .', 'for syme thirsted first and last to get clear of the whole poisonous atmosphere  if only for an hour .', 'then he could collect his thoughts  formulate his policy  and decide finally whether he should or should not keep faith with gregory .', 'he strolled away through the dancing snow  turned up two or three streets  down through two or three others  and entered a small soho restaurant for lunch .', 'he partook reflectively of four small and quaint courses  drank half a bottle of red wine  and ended up over black coffee and a black cigar  still thinking .', 'he had taken his seat in the upper room of the restaurant  which was full of the chink of knives and the chatter of foreigners .', 'he remembered that in old days he had imagined that all these harmless and kindly aliens were anarchists .', 'he shuddered  remembering the real thing .', 'but even the shudder had the delightful shame of escape .', 'the wine  the common food  the familiar place  the faces of natural and talkative men  made him almost feel as if the council of the seven days had been a bad dream  and although he knew it was nevertheless an objective reality  it was at least a distant one .', 'tall houses and populous streets lay between him and his last sight of the shameful seven  he was free in free london  and drinking wine among the free .', 'with a somewhat easier action  he took his hat and stick and strolled down the stair into the shop below .', 'when he entered that lower room he stood stricken and rooted to the spot .', 'at a small table  close up to the blank window and the white street of snow  sat the old anarchist professor over a glass of milk  with his lifted livid face and pendent eyelids .', 'for an instant syme stood as rigid as the stick he leant upon .', 'then with a gesture as of blind hurry  he brushed past the professor  dashing open the door and slamming it behind him  and stood outside in the snow .', ' can that old corpse be following me ', 'he asked himself  biting his yellow moustache .', ' i stopped too long up in that room  so that even such leaden feet could catch me up .', 'one comfort is  with a little brisk walking i can put a man like that as far away as timbuctoo .', 'or am i too fanciful ', 'was he really following me ', 'surely sunday would not be such a fool as to send a lame man  ', 'he set off at a smart pace  twisting and whirling his stick  in the direction of covent garden .', 'as he crossed the great market the snow increased  growing blinding and bewildering as the afternoon began to darken .', 'the snow  flakes tormented him like a swarm of silver bees .', 'getting into his eyes and beard  they added their unremitting futility to his already irritated nerves  and by the time that he had come at a swinging pace to the beginning of fleet street  he lost patience  and finding a sunday teashop  turned into it to take shelter .', 'he ordered another cup of black coffee as an excuse .', 'scarcely had he done so  when professor de worms hobbled heavily into the shop  sat down with difficulty and ordered a glass of milk .', 'syme  s walking  stick had fallen from his hand with a great clang  which confessed the concealed steel .', 'but the professor did not look round .', 'syme  who was commonly a cool character  was literally gaping as a rustic gapes at a conjuring trick .', 'he had seen no cab following  he had heard no wheels outside the shop  to all mortal appearances the man had come on foot .', 'but the old man could only walk like a snail  and syme had walked like the wind .', 'he started up and snatched his stick  half crazy with the contradiction in mere arithmetic  and swung out of the swinging doors  leaving his coffee untasted .', 'an omnibus going to the bank went rattling by with an unusual rapidity .', 'he had a violent run of a hundred yards to reach it  but he managed to spring  swaying upon the splash  board and  pausing for an instant to pant  he climbed on to the top .', 'when he had been seated for about half a minute  he heard behind him a sort of heavy and asthmatic breathing .', 'turning sharply  he saw rising gradually higher and higher up the omnibus steps a top hat soiled and dripping with snow  and under the shadow of its brim the short  sighted face and shaky shoulders of professor de worms .', 'he let himself into a seat with characteristic care  and wrapped himself up to the chin in the mackintosh rug .', 'every movement of the old man  s tottering figure and vague hands  every uncertain gesture and panic  stricken pause  seemed to put it beyond question that he was helpless  that he was in the last imbecility of the body .', 'he moved by inches  he let himself down with little gasps of caution .', 'and yet  unless the philosophical entities called time and space have no vestige even of a practical existence  it appeared quite unquestionable that he had run after the omnibus .', 'syme sprang erect upon the rocking car  and after staring wildly at the wintry sky  that grew gloomier every moment  he ran down the steps .', 'he had repressed an elemental impulse to leap over the side .', 'too bewildered to look back or to reason  he rushed into one of the little courts at the side of fleet street as a rabbit rushes into a hole .', 'he had a vague idea  if this incomprehensible old jack  in  the  box was really pursuing him  that in that labyrinth of little streets he could soon throw him off the scent .', 'he dived in and out of those crooked lanes  which were more like cracks than thoroughfares  and by the time that he had completed about twenty alternate angles and described an unthinkable polygon  he paused to listen for any sound of pursuit .', 'there was none  there could not in any case have been much  for the little streets were thick with the soundless snow .', 'somewhere behind red lion court  however  he noticed a place where some energetic citizen had cleared away the snow for a space of about twenty yards  leaving the wet  glistening cobble  stones .', 'he thought little of this as he passed it  only plunging into yet another arm of the maze .', 'but when a few hundred yards farther on he stood still again to listen  his heart stood still also  for he heard from that space of rugged stones the clinking crutch and labouring feet of the infernal cripple .', 'the sky above was loaded with the clouds of snow  leaving london in a darkness and oppression premature for that hour of the evening .', 'on each side of syme the walls of the alley were blind and featureless  there was no little window or any kind of eve .', 'he felt a new impulse to break out of this hive of houses  and to get once more into the open and lamp  lit street .', 'yet he rambled and dodged for a long time before he struck the main thoroughfare .', 'when he did so  he struck it much farther up than he had fancied .', 'he came out into what seemed the vast and void of ludgate circus  and saw st . paul  s cathedral sitting in the sky .', 'at first he was startled to find these great roads so empty  as if a pestilence had swept through the city .', 'then he told himself that some degree of emptiness was natural  first because the snow  storm was even dangerously deep  and secondly because it was sunday .', 'and at the very word sunday he bit his lip  the word was henceforth for hire like some indecent pun .', 'under the white fog of snow high up in the heaven the whole atmosphere of the city was turned to a very queer kind of green twilight  as of men under the sea .', 'the sealed and sullen sunset behind the dark dome of st . paul  s had in it smoky and sinister colours  colours of sickly green  dead red or decaying bronze  that were just bright enough to emphasise the solid whiteness of the snow .', 'but right up against these dreary colours rose the black bulk of the cathedral  and upon the top of the cathedral was a random splash and great stain of snow  still clinging as to an alpine peak .', 'it had fallen accidentally  but just so fallen as to half drape the dome from its very topmost point  and to pick out in perfect silver the great orb and the cross .', 'when syme saw it he suddenly straightened himself  and made with his sword  stick an involuntary salute .', 'he knew that that evil figure  his shadow  was creeping quickly or slowly behind him  and he did not care .', 'it seemed a symbol of human faith and valour that while the skies were darkening that high place of the earth was bright .', 'the devils might have captured heaven  but they had not yet captured the cross .', 'he had a new impulse to tear out the secret of this dancing  jumping and pursuing paralytic  and at the entrance of the court as it opened upon the circus he turned  stick in hand  to face his pursuer .', 'professor de worms came slowly round the corner of the irregular alley behind him  his unnatural form outlined against a lonely gas  lamp  irresistibly recalling that very imaginative figure in the nursery rhymes   the crooked man who went a crooked mile .', 'he really looked as if he had been twisted out of shape by the tortuous streets he had been threading .', 'he came nearer and nearer  the lamplight shining on his lifted spectacles  his lifted  patient face .', 'syme waited for him as st . george waited for the dragon  as a man waits for a final explanation or for death .', 'and the old professor came right up to him and passed him like a total stranger  without even a blink of his mournful eyelids .', 'there was something in this silent and unexpected innocence that left syme in a final fury .', 'the man  s colourless face and manner seemed to assert that the whole following had been an accident .', 'syme was galvanised with an energy that was something between bitterness and a burst of boyish derision .', 'he made a wild gesture as if to knock the old man  s hat off  called out something like  catch me if you can  and went racing away across the white  open circus .', 'concealment was impossible now  and looking back over his shoulder  he could see the black figure of the old gentleman coming after him with long  swinging strides like a man winning a mile race .', 'but the head upon that bounding body was still pale  grave and professional  like the head of a lecturer upon the body of a harlequin .', 'this outrageous chase sped across ludgate circus  up ludgate hill  round st . paul  s cathedral  along cheapside  syme remembering all the nightmares he had ever known .', 'then syme broke away towards the river  and ended almost down by the docks .', 'he saw the yellow panes of a low  lighted public  house  flung himself into it and ordered beer .', 'it was a foul tavern  sprinkled with foreign sailors  a place where opium might be smoked or knives drawn .', 'a moment later professor de worms entered the place  sat down carefully  and asked for a glass of milk .', 'chapter viii', 'the professor explains', 'when gabriel syme found himself finally established in a chair  and opposite to him  fixed and final also  the lifted eyebrows and leaden eyelids of the professor  his fears fully returned .', 'this incomprehensible man from the fierce council  after all  had certainly pursued him .', 'if the man had one character as a paralytic and another character as a pursuer  the antithesis might make him more interesting  but scarcely more soothing .', 'it would be a very small comfort that he could not find the professor out  if by some serious accident the professor should find him out .', 'he emptied a whole pewter pot of ale before the professor had touched his milk .', 'one possibility  however  kept him hopeful and yet helpless .', 'it was just possible that this escapade signified something other than even a slight suspicion of him .', 'perhaps it was some regular form or sign .', 'perhaps the foolish scamper was some sort of friendly signal that he ought to have understood .', 'perhaps it was a ritual .', 'perhaps the new thursday was always chased along cheapside  as the new lord mayor is always escorted along it .', 'he was just selecting a tentative inquiry  when the old professor opposite suddenly and simply cut him short .', 'before syme could ask the first diplomatic question  the old anarchist had asked suddenly  without any sort of preparation ', ' are you a policeman ', 'whatever else syme had expected  he had never expected anything so brutal and actual as this .', 'even his great presence of mind could only manage a reply with an air of rather blundering jocularity .', ' a policeman ', 'he said  laughing vaguely .', ' whatever made you think of a policeman in connection with me ', ' the process was simple enough  answered the professor patiently .', ' i thought you looked like a policeman .', 'i think so now .', ' did i take a policeman  s hat by mistake out of the restaurant ', 'asked syme  smiling wildly .', ' have i by any chance got a number stuck on to me somewhere ', 'have my boots got that watchful look ', 'why must i be a policeman ', 'do  do let me be a postman .', 'the old professor shook his head with a gravity that gave no hope  but syme ran on with a feverish irony .', ' but perhaps i misunderstood the delicacies of your german philosophy .', 'perhaps policeman is a relative term .', 'in an evolutionary sense  sir  the ape fades so gradually into the policeman  that i myself can never detect the shade .', 'the monkey is only the policeman that may be .', 'perhaps a maiden lady on clapham common is only the policeman that might have been .', 'i don  t mind being the policeman that might have been .', 'i don  t mind being anything in german thought .', ' are you in the police service ', 'said the old man  ignoring all syme  s improvised and desperate raillery .', ' are you a detective ', 'syme  s heart turned to stone  but his face never changed .', ' your suggestion is ridiculous  he began .', ' why on earth ', 'the old man struck his palsied hand passionately on the rickety table  nearly breaking it .', ' did you hear me ask a plain question  you pattering spy ', 'he shrieked in a high  crazy voice .', ' are you  or are you not  a police detective ', ' no ', 'answered syme  like a man standing on the hangman  s drop .', ' you swear it  said the old man  leaning across to him  his dead face becoming as it were loathsomely alive .', ' you swear it ', 'you swear it ', 'if you swear falsely  will you be damned ', 'will you be sure that the devil dances at your funeral ', 'will you see that the nightmare sits on your grave ', 'will there really be no mistake ', 'you are an anarchist  you are a dynamiter ', 'above all  you are not in any sense a detective ', 'you are not in the british police ', 'he leant his angular elbow far across the table  and put up his large loose hand like a flap to his ear .', ' i am not in the british police  said syme with insane calm .', 'professor de worms fell back in his chair with a curious air of kindly collapse .', ' that  s a pity  he said   because i am .', 'syme sprang up straight  sending back the bench behind him with a crash .', ' because you are what ', 'he said thickly .', ' you are what ', ' i am a policeman  said the professor with his first broad smile .', 'and beaming through his spectacles .', ' but as you think policeman only a relative term  of course i have nothing to do with you .', 'i am in the british police force  but as you tell me you are not in the british police force  i can only say that i met you in a dynamiters  club .', 'i suppose i ought to arrest you .', 'and with these words he laid on the table before syme an exact facsimile of the blue card which syme had in his own waistcoat pocket  the symbol of his power from the police .', 'syme had for a flash the sensation that the cosmos had turned exactly upside down  that all trees were growing downwards and that all stars were under his feet .', 'then came slowly the opposite conviction .', 'for the last twenty  four hours the cosmos had really been upside down  but now the capsized universe had come right side up again .', 'this devil from whom he had been fleeing all day was only an elder brother of his own house  who on the other side of the table lay back and laughed at him .', 'he did not for the moment ask any questions of detail  he only knew the happy and silly fact that this shadow  which had pursued him with an intolerable oppression of peril  was only the shadow of a friend trying to catch him up .', 'he knew simultaneously that he was a fool and a free man .', 'for with any recovery from morbidity there must go a certain healthy humiliation .', 'there comes a certain point in such conditions when only three things are possible  first a perpetuation of satanic pride  secondly tears  and third laughter .', 'syme  s egotism held hard to the first course for a few seconds  and then suddenly adopted the third .', 'taking his own blue police ticket from his own waist coat pocket  he tossed it on to the table  then he flung his head back until his spike of yellow beard almost pointed at the ceiling  and shouted with a barbaric laughter .', 'even in that close den  perpetually filled with the din of knives  plates  cans  clamorous voices  sudden struggles and stampedes  there was something homeric in syme  s mirth which made many half  drunken men look round .', ' what yer laughing at  guv  nor ', 'asked one wondering labourer from the docks .', ' at myself  answered syme  and went off again into the agony of his ecstatic reaction .', ' pull yourself together  said the professor   or you  ll get hysterical .', 'have some more beer .', 'i  ll join you .', ' you haven  t drunk your milk  said syme .', ' my milk ', 'said the other  in tones of withering and unfathomable contempt   my milk ', 'do you think i  d look at the beastly stuff when i  m out of sight of the bloody anarchists ', 'we  re all christians in this room  though perhaps  he added  glancing around at the reeling crowd   not strict ones .', 'finish my milk ', 'great blazes ', 'yes  i  ll finish it right enough ', 'and he knocked the tumbler off the table  making a crash of glass and a splash of silver fluid .', 'syme was staring at him with a happy curiosity .', ' i understand now  he cried   of course  you  re not an old man at all .', ' i can  t take my face off here  replied professor de worms .', ' it  s rather an elaborate make  up .', 'as to whether i  m an old man  that  s not for me to say .', 'i was thirty  eight last birthday .', ' yes  but i mean  said syme impatiently   there  s nothing the matter with you .', ' yes  answered the other dispassionately .', ' i am subject to colds .', 'syme  s laughter at all this had about it a wild weakness of relief .', 'he laughed at the idea of the paralytic professor being really a young actor dressed up as if for the foot  lights .', 'but he felt that he would have laughed as loudly if a pepperpot had fallen over .', 'the false professor drank and wiped his false beard .', ' did you know  he asked   that that man gogol was one of us ', ' i ', 'no  i didn  t know it  answered syme in some surprise .', ' but didn  t you ', ' i knew no more than the dead  replied the man who called himself de worms .', ' i thought the president was talking about me  and i rattled in my boots .', ' and i thought he was talking about me  said syme  with his rather reckless laughter .', ' i had my hand on my revolver all the time .', ' so had i  said the professor grimly   so had gogol evidently .', 'syme struck the table with an exclamation .', ' why  there were three of us there ', 'he cried .', ' three out of seven is a fighting number .', 'if we had only known that we were three ', 'the face of professor de worms darkened  and he did not look up .', ' we were three  he said .', ' if we had been three hundred we could still have done nothing .', ' not if we were three hundred against four ', 'asked syme  jeering rather boisterously .', ' no  said the professor with sobriety   not if we were three hundred against sunday .', 'and the mere name struck syme cold and serious  his laughter had died in his heart before it could die on his lips .', 'the face of the unforgettable president sprang into his mind as startling as a coloured photograph  and he remarked this difference between sunday and all his satellites  that their faces  however fierce or sinister  became gradually blurred by memory like other human faces  whereas sunday  s seemed almost to grow more actual during absence  as if a man  s painted portrait should slowly come alive .', 'they were both silent for a measure of moments  and then syme  s speech came with a rush  like the sudden foaming of champagne .', ' professor  he cried   it is intolerable .', 'are you afraid of this man ', 'the professor lifted his heavy lids  and gazed at syme with large  wide  open  blue eyes of an almost ethereal honesty .', ' yes  i am  he said mildly .', ' so are you .', 'syme was dumb for an instant .', 'then he rose to his feet erect  like an insulted man  and thrust the chair away from him .', ' yes  he said in a voice indescribable   you are right .', 'i am afraid of him .', 'therefore i swear by god that i will seek out this man whom i fear until i find him  and strike him on the mouth .', 'if heaven were his throne and the earth his footstool  i swear that i would pull him down .', ' how ', 'asked the staring professor .', ' why ', ' because i am afraid of him  said syme   and no man should leave in the universe anything of which he is afraid .', 'de worms blinked at him with a sort of blind wonder .', 'he made an effort to speak  but syme went on in a low voice  but with an undercurrent of inhuman exaltation ', ' who would condescend to strike down the mere things that he does not fear ', 'who would debase himself to be merely brave  like any common prizefighter ', 'who would stoop to be fearless  like a tree ', 'fight the thing that you fear .', 'you remember the old tale of the english clergyman who gave the last rites to the brigand of sicily  and how on his death  bed the great robber said   i can give you no money  but i can give you advice for a lifetime  your thumb on the blade  and strike upwards .', 'so i say to you  strike upwards  if you strike at the stars .', 'the other looked at the ceiling  one of the tricks of his pose .', ' sunday is a fixed star  he said .', ' you shall see him a falling star  said syme  and put on his hat .', 'the decision of his gesture drew the professor vaguely to his feet .', ' have you any idea  he asked  with a sort of benevolent bewilderment   exactly where you are going ', ' yes  replied syme shortly   i am going to prevent this bomb being thrown in paris .', ' have you any conception how ', 'inquired the other .', ' no  said syme with equal decision .', ' you remember  of course  resumed the soi  disant de worms  pulling his beard and looking out of the window   that when we broke up rather hurriedly the whole arrangements for the atrocity were left in the private hands of the marquis and dr . bull .', 'the marquis is by this time probably crossing the channel .', 'but where he will go and what he will do it is doubtful whether even the president knows  certainly we don  t know .', 'the only man who does know is dr . bull .', ' confound it ', 'cried syme .', ' and we don  t know where he is .', ' yes  said the other in his curious  absent  minded way   i know where he is myself .', ' will you tell me ', 'asked syme with eager eyes .', ' i will take you there  said the professor  and took down his own hat from a peg .', 'syme stood looking at him with a sort of rigid excitement .', ' what do you mean ', 'he asked sharply .', ' will you join me ', 'will you take the risk ', ' young man  said the professor pleasantly   i am amused to observe that you think i am a coward .', 'as to that i will say only one word  and that shall be entirely in the manner of your own philosophical rhetoric .', 'you think that it is possible to pull down the president .', 'i know that it is impossible  and i am going to try it  and opening the tavern door  which let in a blast of bitter air  they went out together into the dark streets by the docks .', 'most of the snow was melted or trampled to mud  but here and there a clot of it still showed grey rather than white in the gloom .', 'the small streets were sloppy and full of pools  which reflected the flaming lamps irregularly  and by accident  like fragments of some other and fallen world .', 'syme felt almost dazed as he stepped through this growing confusion of lights and shadows  but his companion walked on with a certain briskness  towards where  at the end of the street  an inch or two of the lamplit river looked like a bar of flame .', ' where are you going ', 'syme inquired .', ' just now  answered the professor   i am going just round the corner to see whether dr . bull has gone to bed .', 'he is hygienic  and retires early .', ' dr .', 'bull ', 'exclaimed syme .', ' does he live round the corner ', ' no  answered his friend .', ' as a matter of fact he lives some way off  on the other side of the river  but we can tell from here whether he has gone to bed .', 'turning the corner as he spoke  and facing the dim river  flecked with flame  he pointed with his stick to the other bank .', 'on the surrey side at this point there ran out into the thames  seeming almost to overhang it  a bulk and cluster of those tall tenements  dotted with lighted windows  and rising like factory chimneys to an almost insane height .', 'their special poise and position made one block of buildings especially look like a tower of babel with a hundred eyes .', 'syme had never seen any of the sky  scraping buildings in america  so he could only think of the buildings in a dream .', 'even as he stared  the highest light in this innumerably lighted turret abruptly went out  as if this black argus had winked at him with one of his innumerable eyes .', 'professor de worms swung round on his heel  and struck his stick against his boot .', ' we are too late  he said   the hygienic doctor has gone to bed .', ' what do you mean ', 'asked syme .', ' does he live over there  then ', ' yes  said de worms   behind that particular window which you can  t see .', 'come along and get some dinner .', 'we must call on him tomorrow morning .', 'without further parley  he led the way through several by  ways until they came out into the flare and clamour of the east india dock road .', 'the professor  who seemed to know his way about the neighbourhood  proceeded to a place where the line of lighted shops fell back into a sort of abrupt twilight and quiet  in which an old white inn  all out of repair  stood back some twenty feet from the road .', ' you can find good english inns left by accident everywhere  like fossils  explained the professor .', ' i once found a decent place in the west end .', ' i suppose  said syme  smiling   that this is the corresponding decent place in the east end ', ' it is  said the professor reverently  and went in .', 'in that place they dined and slept  both very thoroughly .', 'the beans and bacon  which these unaccountable people cooked well  the astonishing emergence of burgundy from their cellars  crowned syme  s sense of a new comradeship and comfort .', 'through all this ordeal his root horror had been isolation  and there are no words to express the abyss between isolation and having one ally .', 'it may be conceded to the mathematicians that four is twice two .', 'but two is not twice one  two is two thousand times one .', 'that is why  in spite of a hundred disadvantages  the world will always return to monogamy .', 'syme was able to pour out for the first time the whole of his outrageous tale  from the time when gregory had taken him to the little tavern by the river .', 'he did it idly and amply  in a luxuriant monologue  as a man speaks with very old friends .', 'on his side  also  the man who had impersonated professor de worms was not less communicative .', 'his own story was almost as silly as syme  s .', ' that  s a good get  up of yours  said syme  draining a glass of macon   a lot better than old gogol  s .', 'even at the start i thought he was a bit too hairy .', ' a difference of artistic theory  replied the professor pensively .', ' gogol was an idealist .', 'he made up as the abstract or platonic ideal of an anarchist .', 'but i am a realist .', 'i am a portrait painter .', 'but  indeed  to say that i am a portrait painter is an inadequate expression .', 'i am a portrait .', ' i don  t understand you  said syme .', ' i am a portrait  repeated the professor .', ' i am a portrait of the celebrated professor de worms  who is  i believe  in naples .', ' you mean you are made up like him  said syme .', ' but doesn  t he know that you are taking his nose in vain ', ' he knows it right enough  replied his friend cheerfully .', ' then why doesn  t he denounce you ', ' i have denounced him  answered the professor .', ' do explain yourself  said syme .', ' with pleasure  if you don  t mind hearing my story  replied the eminent foreign philosopher .', ' i am by profession an actor  and my name is wilks .', 'when i was on the stage i mixed with all sorts of bohemian and blackguard company .', 'sometimes i touched the edge of the turf  sometimes the riff  raff of the arts  and occasionally the political refugee .', 'in some den of exiled dreamers i was introduced to the great german nihilist philosopher  professor de worms .', 'i did not gather much about him beyond his appearance  which was very disgusting  and which i studied carefully .', 'i understood that he had proved that the destructive principle in the universe was god  hence he insisted on the need for a furious and incessant energy  rending all things in pieces .', 'energy  he said  was the all .', 'he was lame  shortsighted  and partially paralytic .', 'when i met him i was in a frivolous mood  and i disliked him so much that i resolved to imitate him .', 'if i had been a draughtsman i would have drawn a caricature .', 'i was only an actor  i could only act a caricature .', 'i made myself up into what was meant for a wild exaggeration of the old professor  s dirty old self .', 'when i went into the room full of his supporters i expected to be received with a roar of laughter  or  if they were too far gone  with a roar of indignation at the insult .', 'i cannot describe the surprise i felt when my entrance was received with a respectful silence  followed  when i had first opened my lips  with a murmur of admiration .', 'the curse of the perfect artist had fallen upon me .', 'i had been too subtle  i had been too true .', 'they thought i really was the great nihilist professor .', 'i was a healthy  minded young man at the time  and i confess that it was a blow .', 'before i could fully recover  however  two or three of these admirers ran up to me radiating indignation  and told me that a public insult had been put upon me in the next room .', 'i inquired its nature .', 'it seemed that an impertinent fellow had dressed himself up as a preposterous parody of myself .', 'i had drunk more champagne than was good for me  and in a flash of folly i decided to see the situation through .', 'consequently it was to meet the glare of the company and my own lifted eyebrows and freezing eyes that the real professor came into the room .', ' i need hardly say there was a collision .', 'the pessimists all round me looked anxiously from one professor to the other professor to see which was really the more feeble .', 'but i won .', 'an old man in poor health  like my rival  could not be expected to be so impressively feeble as a young actor in the prime of life .', 'you see  he really had paralysis  and working within this definite limitation  he couldn  t be so jolly paralytic as i was .', 'then he tried to blast my claims intellectually .', 'i countered that by a very simple dodge .', 'whenever he said something that nobody but he could understand  i replied with something which i could not even understand myself .', ' i don  t fancy  he said   that you could have worked out the principle that evolution is only negation  since there inheres in it the introduction of lacuna  which are an essential of differentiation .', 'i replied quite scornfully   you read all that up in pinckwerts  the notion that involution functioned eugenically was exposed long ago by glumpe .', 'it is unnecessary for me to say that there never were such people as pinckwerts and glumpe .', 'but the people all round  rather to my surprise  seemed to remember them quite well  and the professor  finding that the learned and mysterious method left him rather at the mercy of an enemy slightly deficient in scruples  fell back upon a more popular form of wit .', ' i see  he sneered   you prevail like the false pig in aesop .', ' and you fail  i answered  smiling   like the hedgehog in montaigne .', 'need i say that there is no hedgehog in montaigne ', ' your claptrap comes off  he said   so would your beard .', 'i had no intelligent answer to this  which was quite true and rather witty .', 'but i laughed heartily  answered   like the pantheist  s boots  at random  and turned on my heel with all the honours of victory .', 'the real professor was thrown out  but not with violence  though one man tried very patiently to pull off his nose .', 'he is now  i believe  received everywhere in europe as a delightful impostor .', 'his apparent earnestness and anger  you see  make him all the more entertaining .', ' well  said syme   i can understand your putting on his dirty old beard for a night  s practical joke  but i don  t understand your never taking it off again .', ' that is the rest of the story  said the impersonator .', ' when i myself left the company  followed by reverent applause  i went limping down the dark street  hoping that i should soon be far enough away to be able to walk like a human being .', 'to my astonishment  as i was turning the corner  i felt a touch on the shoulder  and turning  found myself under the shadow of an enormous policeman .', 'he told me i was wanted .', 'i struck a sort of paralytic attitude  and cried in a high german accent   yes  i am wanted  by the oppressed of the world .', 'you are arresting me on the charge of being the great anarchist  professor de worms .', 'the policeman impassively consulted a paper in his hand   no  sir  he said civilly   at least  not exactly  sir .', 'i am arresting you on the charge of not being the celebrated anarchist  professor de worms .', 'this charge  if it was criminal at all  was certainly the lighter of the two  and i went along with the man  doubtful  but not greatly dismayed .', 'i was shown into a number of rooms  and eventually into the presence of a police officer  who explained that a serious campaign had been opened against the centres of anarchy  and that this  my successful masquerade  might be of considerable value to the public safety .', 'he offered me a good salary and this little blue card .', 'though our conversation was short  he struck me as a man of very massive common sense and humour  but i cannot tell you much about him personally  because ', 'syme laid down his knife and fork .', ' i know  he said   because you talked to him in a dark room .', 'professor de worms nodded and drained his glass .', 'chapter ix', 'the man in spectacles', ' burgundy is a jolly thing  said the professor sadly  as he set his glass down .', ' you don  t look as if it were  said syme   you drink it as if it were medicine .', ' you must excuse my manner  said the professor dismally   my position is rather a curious one .', 'inside i am really bursting with boyish merriment  but i acted the paralytic professor so well  that now i can  t leave off .', 'so that when i am among friends  and have no need at all to disguise myself  i still can  t help speaking slow and wrinkling my forehead  just as if it were my forehead .', 'i can be quite happy  you understand  but only in a paralytic sort of way .', 'the most buoyant exclamations leap up in my heart  but they come out of my mouth quite different .', 'you should hear me say   buck up  old cock ', 'it would bring tears to your eyes .', ' it does  said syme   but i cannot help thinking that apart from all that you are really a bit worried .', 'the professor started a little and looked at him steadily .', ' you are a very clever fellow  he said   it is a pleasure to work with you .', 'yes  i have rather a heavy cloud in my head .', 'there is a great problem to face  and he sank his bald brow in his two hands .', 'then he said in a low voice ', ' can you play the piano ', ' yes  said syme in simple wonder   i  m supposed to have a good touch .', 'then  as the other did not speak  he added ', ' i trust the great cloud is lifted .', 'after a long silence  the professor said out of the cavernous shadow of his hands ', ' it would have done just as well if you could work a typewriter .', ' thank you  said syme   you flatter me .', ' listen to me  said the other   and remember whom we have to see tomorrow .', 'you and i are going tomorrow to attempt something which is very much more dangerous than trying to steal the crown jewels out of the tower .', 'we are trying to steal a secret from a very sharp  very strong  and very wicked man .', 'i believe there is no man  except the president  of course  who is so seriously startling and formidable as that little grinning fellow in goggles .', 'he has not perhaps the white  hot enthusiasm unto death  the mad martyrdom for anarchy  which marks the secretary .', 'but then that very fanaticism in the secretary has a human pathos  and is almost a redeeming trait .', 'but the little doctor has a brutal sanity that is more shocking than the secretary  s disease .', 'don  t you notice his detestable virility and vitality .', 'he bounces like an india  rubber ball .', 'depend on it  sunday was not asleep  i wonder if he ever sleeps ', 'when he locked up all the plans of this outrage in the round  black head of dr .', 'bull .', ' and you think  said syme   that this unique monster will be soothed if i play the piano to him ', ' don  t be an ass  said his mentor .', ' i mentioned the piano because it gives one quick and independent fingers .', 'syme  if we are to go through this interview and come out sane or alive  we must have some code of signals between us that this brute will not see .', 'i have made a rough alphabetical cypher corresponding to the five fingers  like this  see  and he rippled with his fingers on the wooden table  b a d  bad  a word we may frequently require .', 'syme poured himself out another glass of wine  and began to study the scheme .', 'he was abnormally quick with his brains at puzzles  and with his hands at conjuring  and it did not take him long to learn how he might convey simple messages by what would seem to be idle taps upon a table or knee .', 'but wine and companionship had always the effect of inspiring him to a farcical ingenuity  and the professor soon found himself struggling with the too vast energy of the new language  as it passed through the heated brain of syme .', ' we must have several word  signs  said syme seriously  words that we are likely to want  fine shades of meaning .', 'my favourite word is  coeval .', 'what  s yours ', ' do stop playing the goat  said the professor plaintively .', ' you don  t know how serious this is .', ' lush  too  said syme  shaking his head sagaciously   we must have  lush  word applied to grass  don  t you know ', ' do you imagine  asked the professor furiously   that we are going to talk to dr . bull about grass ', ' there are several ways in which the subject could be approached  said syme reflectively   and the word introduced without appearing forced .', 'we might say   dr .', 'bull  as a revolutionist  you remember that a tyrant once advised us to eat grass  and indeed many of us  looking on the fresh lush grass of summer ', ' do you understand  said the other   that this is a tragedy ', ' perfectly  replied syme   always be comic in a tragedy .', 'what the deuce else can you do ', 'i wish this language of yours had a wider scope .', 'i suppose we could not extend it from the fingers to the toes ', 'that would involve pulling off our boots and socks during the conversation  which however unobtrusively performed ', ' syme  said his friend with a stern simplicity   go to bed ', 'syme  however  sat up in bed for a considerable time mastering the new code .', 'he was awakened next morning while the east was still sealed with darkness  and found his grey  bearded ally standing like a ghost beside his bed .', 'syme sat up in bed blinking  then slowly collected his thoughts  threw off the bed  clothes  and stood up .', 'it seemed to him in some curious way that all the safety and sociability of the night before fell with the bedclothes off him  and he stood up in an air of cold danger .', 'he still felt an entire trust and loyalty towards his companion  but it was the trust between two men going to the scaffold .', ' well  said syme with a forced cheerfulness as he pulled on his trousers   i dreamt of that alphabet of yours .', 'did it take you long to make it up ', 'the professor made no answer  but gazed in front of him with eyes the colour of a wintry sea  so syme repeated his question .', ' i say  did it take you long to invent all this ', 'i  m considered good at these things  and it was a good hour  s grind .', 'did you learn it all on the spot ', 'the professor was silent  his eyes were wide open  and he wore a fixed but very small smile .', ' how long did it take you ', 'the professor did not move .', ' confound you  can  t you answer ', 'called out syme  in a sudden anger that had something like fear underneath .', 'whether or no the professor could answer  he did not .', 'syme stood staring back at the stiff face like parchment and the blank  blue eyes .', 'his first thought was that the professor had gone mad  but his second thought was more frightful .', 'after all  what did he know about this queer creature whom he had heedlessly accepted as a friend ', 'what did he know  except that the man had been at the anarchist breakfast and had told him a ridiculous tale ', 'how improbable it was that there should be another friend there beside gogol ', 'was this man  s silence a sensational way of declaring war ', 'was this adamantine stare after all only the awful sneer of some threefold traitor  who had turned for the last time ', 'he stood and strained his ears in this heartless silence .', 'he almost fancied he could hear dynamiters come to capture him shifting softly in the corridor outside .', 'then his eye strayed downwards  and he burst out laughing .', 'though the professor himself stood there as voiceless as a statue  his five dumb fingers were dancing alive upon the dead table .', 'syme watched the twinkling movements of the talking hand  and read clearly the message ', ' i will only talk like this .', 'we must get used to it .', 'he rapped out the answer with the impatience of relief ', ' all right .', 'let  s get out to breakfast .', 'they took their hats and sticks in silence  but as syme took his sword  stick  he held it hard .', 'they paused for a few minutes only to stuff down coffee and coarse thick sandwiches at a coffee stall  and then made their way across the river  which under the grey and growing light looked as desolate as acheron .', 'they reached the bottom of the huge block of buildings which they had seen from across the river  and began in silence to mount the naked and numberless stone steps  only pausing now and then to make short remarks on the rail of the banisters .', 'at about every other flight they passed a window  each window showed them a pale and tragic dawn lifting itself laboriously over london .', 'from each the innumerable roofs of slate looked like the leaden surges of a grey  troubled sea after rain .', 'syme was increasingly conscious that his new adventure had somehow a quality of cold sanity worse than the wild adventures of the past .', 'last night  for instance  the tall tenements had seemed to him like a tower in a dream .', 'as he now went up the weary and perpetual steps  he was daunted and bewildered by their almost infinite series .', 'but it was not the hot horror of a dream or of anything that might be exaggeration or delusion .', 'their infinity was more like the empty infinity of arithmetic  something unthinkable  yet necessary to thought .', 'or it was like the stunning statements of astronomy about the distance of the fixed stars .', 'he was ascending the house of reason  a thing more hideous than unreason itself .', 'by the time they reached dr . bull  s landing  a last window showed them a harsh  white dawn edged with banks of a kind of coarse red  more like red clay than red cloud .', 'and when they entered dr . bull  s bare garret it was full of light .', 'syme had been haunted by a half historic memory in connection with these empty rooms and that austere daybreak .', 'the moment he saw the garret and dr . bull sitting writing at a table  he remembered what the memory was  the french revolution .', 'there should have been the black outline of a guillotine against that heavy red and white of the morning .', 'dr . bull was in his white shirt and black breeches only  his cropped  dark head might well have just come out of its wig  he might have been marat or a more slipshod robespierre .', 'yet when he was seen properly  the french fancy fell away .', 'the jacobins were idealists  there was about this man a murderous materialism .', 'his dosition gave him a somewhat new appearance .', 'the strong  white light of morning coming from one side creating sharp shadows  made him seem both more pale and more angular than he had looked at the breakfast on the balcony .', 'thus the two black glasses that encased his eyes might really have been black cavities in his skull  making him look like a death  s  head .', 'and  indeed  if ever death himself sat writing at a wooden table  it might have been he .', 'he looked up and smiled brightly enough as the men came in  and rose with the resilient rapidity of which the professor had spoken .', 'he set chairs for both of them  and going to a peg behind the door  proceeded to put on a coat and waistcoat of rough  dark tweed  he buttoned it up neatly  and came back to sit down at his table .', 'the quiet good humour of his manner left his two opponents helpless .', 'it was with some momentary difficulty that the professor broke silence and began   i  m sorry to disturb you so early  comrade  said he  with a careful resumption of the slow de worms manner .', ' you have no doubt made all the arrangements for the paris affair ', 'then he added with infinite slowness   we have information which renders intolerable anything in the nature of a moment  s delay .', 'dr . bull smiled again  but continued to gaze on them without speaking .', 'the professor resumed  a pause before each weary word ', ' please do not think me excessively abrupt  but i advise you to alter those plans  or if it is too late for that  to follow your agent with all the support you can get for him .', 'comrade syme and i have had an experience which it would take more time to recount than we can afford  if we are to act on it .', 'i will  however  relate the occurrence in detail  even at the risk of losing time  if you really feel that it is essential to the understanding of the problem we have to discuss .', 'he was spinning out his sentences  making them intolerably long and lingering  in the hope of maddening the practical little doctor into an explosion of impatience which might show his hand .', 'but the little doctor continued only to stare and smile  and the monologue was uphill work .', 'syme began to feel a new sickness and despair .', 'the doctor  s smile and silence were not at all like the cataleptic stare and horrible silence which he had confronted in the professor half an hour before .', 'about the professor  s makeup and all his antics there was always something merely grotesque  like a gollywog .', 'syme remembered those wild woes of yesterday as one remembers being afraid of bogy in childhood .', 'but here was daylight  here was a healthy  square  shouldered man in tweeds  not odd save for the accident of his ugly spectacles  not glaring or grinning at all  but smiling steadily and not saying a word .', 'the whole had a sense of unbearable reality .', 'under the increasing sunlight the colours of the doctor  s complexion  the pattern of his tweeds  grew and expanded outrageously  as such things grow too important in a realistic novel .', 'but his smile was quite slight  the pose of his head polite  the only uncanny thing was his silence .', ' as i say  resumed the professor  like a man toiling through heavy sand   the incident that has occurred to us and has led us to ask for information about the marquis  is one which you may think it better to have narrated  but as it came in the way of comrade syme rather than me ', 'his words he seemed to be dragging out like words in an anthem  but syme  who was watching  saw his long fingers rattle quickly on the edge of the crazy table .', 'he read the message   you must go on .', 'this devil has sucked me dry ', 'syme plunged into the breach with that bravado of improvisation which always came to him when he was alarmed .', ' yes  the thing really happened to me  he said hastily .', ' i had the good fortune to fall into conversation with a detective who took me  thanks to my hat  for a respectable person .', 'wishing to clinch my reputation for respectability  i took him and made him very drunk at the savoy .', 'under this influence he became friendly  and told me in so many words that within a day or two they hope to arrest the marquis in france .', 'so unless you or i can get on his track ', 'the doctor was still smiling in the most friendly way  and his protected eyes were still impenetrable .', 'the professor signalled to syme that he would resume his explanation  and he began again with the same elaborate calm .', ' syme immediately brought this information to me  and we came here together to see what use you would be inclined to make of it .', 'it seems to me unquestionably urgent that ', 'all this time syme had been staring at the doctor almost as steadily as the doctor stared at the professor  but quite without the smile .', 'the nerves of both comrades  in  arms were near snapping under that strain of motionless amiability  when syme suddenly leant forward and idly tapped the edge of the table .', 'his message to his ally ran   i have an intuition .', 'the professor  with scarcely a pause in his monologue  signalled back   then sit on it .', 'syme telegraphed   it is quite extraordinary .', 'the other answered   extraordinary rot ', 'syme said   i am a poet .', 'the other retorted   you are a dead man .', 'syme had gone quite red up to his yellow hair  and his eyes were burning feverishly .', 'as he said he had an intuition  and it had risen to a sort of lightheaded certainty .', 'resuming his symbolic taps  he signalled to his friend   you scarcely realise how poetic my intuition is .', 'it has that sudden quality we sometimes feel in the coming of spring .', 'he then studied the answer on his friend  s fingers .', 'the answer was   go to hell  ', 'the professor then resumed his merely verbal monologue addressed to the doctor .', ' perhaps i should rather say  said syme on his fingers   that it resembles that sudden smell of the sea which may be found in the heart of lush woods .', 'his companion disdained to reply .', ' or yet again  tapped syme   it is positive  as is the passionate red hair of a beautiful woman .', 'the professor was continuing his speech  but in the middle of it syme decided to act .', 'he leant across the table  and said in a voice that could not be neglected ', ' dr .', 'bull ', 'the doctor  s sleek and smiling head did not move  but they could have sworn that under his dark glasses his eyes darted towards syme .', ' dr . bull  said syme  in a voice peculiarly precise and courteous   would you do me a small favour ', 'would you be so kind as to take off your spectacles ', 'the professor swung round on his seat  and stared at syme with a sort of frozen fury of astonishment .', 'syme  like a man who has thrown his life and fortune on the table  leaned forward with a fiery face .', 'the doctor did not move .', 'for a few seconds there was a silence in which one could hear a pin drop  split once by the single hoot of a distant steamer on the thames .', 'then dr . bull rose slowly  still smiling  and took off his spectacles .', 'syme sprang to his feet  stepping backwards a little  like a chemical lecturer from a successful explosion .', 'his eyes were like stars  and for an instant he could only point without speaking .', 'the professor had also started to his feet  forgetful of his supposed paralysis .', 'he leant on the back of the chair and stared doubtfully at dr . bull  as if the doctor had been turned into a toad before his eyes .', 'and indeed it was almost as great a transformation scene .', 'the two detectives saw sitting in the chair before them a very boyish  looking young man  with very frank and happy hazel eyes  an open expression  cockney clothes like those of a city clerk  and an unquestionable breath about him of being very good and rather commonplace .', 'the smile was still there  but it might have been the first smile of a baby .', ' i knew i was a poet  cried syme in a sort of ecstasy .', ' i knew my intuition was as infallible as the pope .', 'it was the spectacles that did it ', 'it was all the spectacles .', 'given those beastly black eyes  and all the rest of him his health and his jolly looks  made him a live devil among dead ones .', ' it certainly does make a queer difference  said the professor shakily .', ' but as regards the project of dr . bull ', ' project be damned ', 'roared syme  beside himself .', ' look at him ', 'look at his face  look at his collar  look at his blessed boots ', 'you don  t suppose  do you  that that thing  s an anarchist ', ' syme ', 'cried the other in an apprehensive agony .', ' why  by god  said syme   i  ll take the risk of that myself ', 'dr . bull  i am a police officer .', 'there  s my card  and he flung down the blue card upon the table .', 'the professor still feared that all was lost  but he was loyal .', 'he pulled out his own official card and put it beside his friend  s .', 'then the third man burst out laughing  and for the first time that morning they heard his voice .', ' i  m awfully glad you chaps have come so early  he said  with a sort of schoolboy flippancy   for we can all start for france together .', 'yes  i  m in the force right enough  and he flicked a blue card towards them lightly as a matter of form .', 'clapping a brisk bowler on his head and resuming his goblin glasses  the doctor moved so quickly towards the door  that the others instinctively followed him .', 'syme seemed a little distrait  and as he passed under the doorway he suddenly struck his stick on the stone passage so that it rang .', ' but lord god almighty  he cried out   if this is all right  there were more damned detectives than there were damned dynamiters at the damned council ', ' we might have fought easily  said bull   we were four against three .', 'the professor was descending the stairs  but his voice came up from below .', ' no  said the voice   we were not four against three  we were not so lucky .', 'we were four against one .', 'the others went down the stairs in silence .', 'the young man called bull  with an innocent courtesy characteristic of him  insisted on going last until they reached the street  but there his own robust rapidity asserted itself unconsciously  and he walked quickly on ahead towards a railway inquiry office  talking to the others over his shoulder .', ' it is jolly to get some pals  he said .', ' i  ve been half dead with the jumps  being quite alone .', 'i nearly flung my arms round gogol and embraced him  which would have been imprudent .', 'i hope you won  t despise me for having been in a blue funk .', ' all the blue devils in blue hell  said syme   contributed to my blue funk ', 'but the worst devil was you and your infernal goggles .', 'the young man laughed delightedly .', ' wasn  t it a rag ', 'he said .', ' such a simple idea  not my own .', 'i haven  t got the brains .', 'you see  i wanted to go into the detective service  especially the anti  dynamite business .', 'but for that purpose they wanted someone to dress up as a dynamiter  and they all swore by blazes that i could never look like a dynamiter .', 'they said my very walk was respectable  and that seen from behind i looked like the british constitution .', 'they said i looked too healthy and too optimistic  and too reliable and benevolent  they called me all sorts of names at scotland yard .', 'they said that if i had been a criminal  i might have made my fortune by looking so like an honest man  but as i had the misfortune to be an honest man  there was not even the remotest chance of my assisting them by ever looking like a criminal .', 'but as last i was brought before some old josser who was high up in the force  and who seemed to have no end of a head on his shoulders .', 'and there the others all talked hopelessly .', 'one asked whether a bushy beard would hide my nice smile  another said that if they blacked my face i might look like a negro anarchist  but this old chap chipped in with a most extraordinary remark .', ' a pair of smoked spectacles will do it  he said positively .', ' look at him now  he looks like an angelic office boy .', 'put him on a pair of smoked spectacles  and children will scream at the sight of him .', 'and so it was  by george ', 'when once my eyes were covered  all the rest  smile and big shoulders and short hair  made me look a perfect little devil .', 'as i say  it was simple enough when it was done  like miracles  but that wasn  t the really miraculous part of it .', 'there was one really staggering thing about the business  and my head still turns at it .', ' what was that ', 'asked syme .', ' i  ll tell you  answered the man in spectacles .', ' this big pot in the police who sized me up so that he knew how the goggles would go with my hair and socks  by god  he never saw me at all ', 'syme  s eyes suddenly flashed on him .', ' how was that ', 'he asked .', ' i thought you talked to him .', ' so i did  said bull brightly   but we talked in a pitch  dark room like a coalcellar .', 'there  you would never have guessed that .', ' i could not have conceived it  said syme gravely .', ' it is indeed a new idea  said the professor .', 'their new ally was in practical matters a whirlwind .', 'at the inquiry office he asked with businesslike brevity about the trains for dover .', 'having got his information  he bundled the company into a cab  and put them and himself inside a railway carriage before they had properly realised the breathless process .', 'they were already on the calais boat before conversation flowed freely .', ' i had already arranged  he explained   to go to france for my lunch  but i am delighted to have someone to lunch with me .', 'you see  i had to send that beast  the marquis  over with his bomb  because the president had his eye on me  though god knows how .', 'i  ll tell you the story some day .', 'it was perfectly choking .', 'whenever i tried to slip out of it i saw the president somewhere  smiling out of the bow  window of a club  or taking off his hat to me from the top of an omnibus .', 'i tell you  you can say what you like  that fellow sold himself to the devil  he can be in six places at once .', ' so you sent the marquis off  i understand  asked the professor .', ' was it long ago ', 'shall we be in time to catch him ', ' yes  answered the new guide   i  ve timed it all .', 'he  ll still be at calais when we arrive .', ' but when we do catch him at calais  said the professor   what are we going to do ', 'at this question the countenance of dr . bull fell for the first time .', 'he reflected a little  and then said ', ' theoretically  i suppose  we ought to call the police .', ' not i  said syme .', ' theoretically i ought to drown myself first .', 'i promised a poor fellow  who was a real modern pessimist  on my word of honour not to tell the police .', 'i  m no hand at casuistry  but i can  t break my word to a modern pessimist .', 'it  s like breaking one  s word to a child .', ' i  m in the same boat  said the professor .', ' i tried to tell the police and i couldn  t  because of some silly oath i took .', 'you see  when i was an actor i was a sort of all  round beast .', 'perjury or treason is the only crime i haven  t committed .', 'if i did that i shouldn  t know the difference between right and wrong .', ' i  ve been through all that  said dr . bull   and i  ve made up my mind .', 'i gave my promise to the secretary  you know him  man who smiles upside down .', 'my friends  that man is the most utterly unhappy man that was ever human .', 'it may be his digestion  or his conscience  or his nerves  or his philosophy of the universe  but he  s damned  he  s in hell ', 'well  i can  t turn on a man like that  and hunt him down .', 'it  s like whipping a leper .', 'i may be mad  but that  s how i feel  and there  s jolly well the end of it .', ' i don  t think you  re mad  said syme .', ' i knew you would decide like that when first you ', ' eh ', 'said dr . bull .', ' when first you took off your spectacles .', 'dr . bull smiled a little  and strolled across the deck to look at the sunlit sea .', 'then he strolled back again  kicking his heels carelessly  and a companionable silence fell between the three men .', ' well  said syme   it seems that we have all the same kind of morality or immorality  so we had better face the fact that comes of it .', ' yes  assented the professor   you  re quite right  and we must hurry up  for i can see the grey nose standing out from france .', ' the fact that comes of it  said syme seriously   is this  that we three are alone on this planet .', 'gogol has gone  god knows where  perhaps the president has smashed him like a fly .', 'on the council we are three men against three  like the romans who held the bridge .', 'but we are worse off than that  first because they can appeal to their organization and we cannot appeal to ours  and second because ', ' because one of those other three men  said the professor   is not a man .', 'syme nodded and was silent for a second or two  then he said ', ' my idea is this .', 'we must do something to keep the marquis in calais till tomorrow midday .', 'i have turned over twenty schemes in my head .', 'we cannot denounce him as a dynamiter  that is agreed .', 'we cannot get him detained on some trivial charge  for we should have to appear  he knows us  and he would smell a rat .', 'we cannot pretend to keep him on anarchist business  he might swallow much in that way  but not the notion of stopping in calais while the czar went safely through paris .', 'we might try to kidnap him  and lock him up ourselves  but he is a well  known man here .', 'he has a whole bodyguard of friends  he is very strong and brave  and the event is doubtful .', 'the only thing i can see to do is actually to take advantage of the very things that are in the marquis  s favour .', 'i am going to profit by the fact that he is a highly respected nobleman .', 'i am going to profit by the fact that he has many friends and moves in the best society .', ' what the devil are you talking about ', 'asked the professor .', ' the symes are first mentioned in the fourteenth century  said syme   but there is a tradition that one of them rode behind bruce at bannockburn .', 'since  the tree is quite clear .', ' he  s gone off his head  said the little doctor  staring .', ' our bearings  continued syme calmly   are  argent a chevron gules charged with three cross crosslets of the field .', 'the motto varies .', 'the professor seized syme roughly by the waistcoat .', ' we are just inshore  he said .', ' are you seasick or joking in the wrong place ', ' my remarks are almost painfully practical  answered syme  in an unhurried manner .', ' the house of st . eustache also is very ancient .', 'the marquis cannot deny that he is a gentleman .', 'he cannot deny that i am a gentleman .', 'and in order to put the matter of my social position quite beyond a doubt  i propose at the earliest opportunity to knock his hat off .', 'but here we are in the harbour .', 'they went on shore under the strong sun in a sort of daze .', 'syme  who had now taken the lead as bull had taken it in london  led them along a kind of marine parade until he came to some cafes  embowered in a bulk of greenery and overlooking the sea .', 'as he went before them his step was slightly swaggering  and he swung his stick like a sword .', 'he was making apparently for the extreme end of the line of cafes  but he stopped abruptly .', 'with a sharp gesture he motioned them to silence  but he pointed with one gloved finger to a cafe table under a bank of flowering foliage at which sat the marquis de st . eustache  his teeth shining in his thick  black beard  and his bold  brown face shadowed by a light yellow straw hat and outlined against the violet sea .', 'chapter x', 'the duel', 'syme sat down at a cafe table with his companions  his blue eyes sparkling like the bright sea below  and ordered a bottle of saumur with a pleased impatience .', 'he was for some reason in a condition of curious hilarity .', 'his spirits were already unnaturally high  they rose as the saumur sank  and in half an hour his talk was a torrent of nonsense .', 'he professed to be making out a plan of the conversation which was going to ensue between himself and the deadly marquis .', 'he jotted it down wildly with a pencil .', 'it was arranged like a printed catechism  with questions and answers  and was delivered with an extraordinary rapidity of utterance .', ' i shall approach .', 'before taking off his hat  i shall take off my own .', 'i shall say   the marquis de saint eustache  i believe .', 'he will say   the celebrated mr . syme  i presume .', 'he will say in the most exquisite french   how are you ', 'i shall reply in the most exquisite cockney   oh  just the syme  ', ' oh  shut it  said the man in spectacles .', ' pull yourself together  and chuck away that bit of paper .', 'what are you really going to do ', ' but it was a lovely catechism  said syme pathetically .', ' do let me read it you .', 'it has only forty  three questions and answers  and some of the marquis  s answers are wonderfully witty .', 'i like to be just to my enemy .', ' but what  s the good of it all ', 'asked dr . bull in exasperation .', ' it leads up to my challenge  don  t you see  said syme  beaming .', ' when the marquis has given the thirty  ninth reply  which runs ', ' has it by any chance occurred to you  asked the professor  with a ponderous simplicity   that the marquis may not say all the forty  three things you have put down for him ', 'in that case  i understand  your own epigrams may appear somewhat more forced .', 'syme struck the table with a radiant face .', ' why  how true that is  he said   and i never thought of it .', 'sir  you have an intellect beyond the common .', 'you will make a name .', ' oh  you  re as drunk as an owl ', 'said the doctor .', ' it only remains  continued syme quite unperturbed   to adopt some other method of breaking the ice  if i may so express it  between myself and the man i wish to kill .', 'and since the course of a dialogue cannot be predicted by one of its parties alone  as you have pointed out with such recondite acumen  the only thing to be done  i suppose  is for the one party  as far as possible  to do all the dialogue by himself .', 'and so i will  by george ', 'and he stood up suddenly  his yellow hair blowing in the slight sea breeze .', 'a band was playing in a cafe chantant hidden somewhere among the trees  and a woman had just stopped singing .', 'on syme  s heated head the bray of the brass band seemed like the jar and jingle of that barrel  organ in leicester square  to the tune of which he had once stood up to die .', 'he looked across to the little table where the marquis sat .', 'the man had two companions now  solemn frenchmen in frock  coats and silk hats  one of them with the red rosette of the legion of honour  evidently people of a solid social position .', 'besides these black  cylindrical costumes  the marquis  in his loose straw hat and light spring clothes  looked bohemian and even barbaric  but he looked the marquis .', 'indeed  one might say that he looked the king  with his animal elegance  his scornful eyes  and his proud head lifted against the purple sea .', 'but he was no christian king  at any rate  he was  rather  some swarthy despot  half greek  half asiatic  who in the days when slavery seemed natural looked down on the mediterranean  on his galley and his groaning slaves .', 'just so  syme thought  would the brown  gold face of such a tyrant have shown against the dark green olives and the burning blue .', ' are you going to address the meeting ', 'asked the professor peevishly  seeing that syme still stood up without moving .', 'syme drained his last glass of sparkling wine .', ' i am  he said  pointing across to the marquis and his companions   that meeting .', 'that meeting displeases me .', 'i am going to pull that meeting  s great ugly  mahogany  coloured nose .', 'he stepped across swiftly  if not quite steadily .', 'the marquis  seeing him  arched his black assyrian eyebrows in surprise  but smiled politely .', ' you are mr . syme  i think  he said .', 'syme bowed .', ' and you are the marquis de saint eustache  he said gracefully .', ' permit me to pull your nose .', 'he leant over to do so  but the marquis started backwards  upsetting his chair  and the two men in top hats held syme back by the shoulders .', ' this man has insulted me ', 'said syme  with gestures of explanation .', ' insulted you ', 'cried the gentleman with the red rosette   when ', ' oh  just now  said syme recklessly .', ' he insulted my mother .', ' insulted your mother ', 'exclaimed the gentleman incredulously .', ' well  anyhow  said syme  conceding a point   my aunt .', ' but how can the marquis have insulted your aunt just now ', 'said the second gentleman with some legitimate wonder .', ' he has been sitting here all the time .', ' ah  it was what he said ', 'said syme darkly .', ' i said nothing at all  said the marquis   except something about the band .', 'i only said that i liked wagner played well .', ' it was an allusion to my family  said syme firmly .', ' my aunt played wagner badly .', 'it was a painful subject .', 'we are always being insulted about it .', ' this seems most extraordinary  said the gentleman who was decore  looking doubtfully at the marquis .', ' oh  i assure you  said syme earnestly   the whole of your conversation was simply packed with sinister allusions to my aunt  s weaknesses .', ' this is nonsense ', 'said the second gentleman .', ' i for one have said nothing for half an hour except that i liked the singing of that girl with black hair .', ' well  there you are again ', 'said syme indignantly .', ' my aunt  s was red .', ' it seems to me  said the other   that you are simply seeking a pretext to insult the marquis .', ' by george ', 'said syme  facing round and looking at him   what a clever chap you are ', 'the marquis started up with eyes flaming like a tiger  s .', ' seeking a quarrel with me ', 'he cried .', ' seeking a fight with me ', 'by god ', 'there was never a man who had to seek long .', 'these gentlemen will perhaps act for me .', 'there are still four hours of daylight .', 'let us fight this evening .', 'syme bowed with a quite beautiful graciousness .', ' marquis  he said   your action is worthy of your fame and blood .', 'permit me to consult for a moment with the gentlemen in whose hands i shall place myself .', 'in three long strides he rejoined his companions  and they  who had seen his champagne  inspired attack and listened to his idiotic explanations  were quite startled at the look of him .', 'for now that he came back to them he was quite sober  a little pale  and he spoke in a low voice of passionate practicality .', ' i have done it  he said hoarsely .', ' i have fixed a fight on the beast .', 'but look here  and listen carefully .', 'there is no time for talk .', 'you are my seconds  and everything must come from you .', 'now you must insist  and insist absolutely  on the duel coming off after seven tomorrow  so as to give me the chance of preventing him from catching the  .  for paris .', 'if he misses that he misses his crime .', 'he can  t refuse to meet you on such a small point of time and place .', 'but this is what he will do .', 'he will choose a field somewhere near a wayside station  where he can pick up the train .', 'he is a very good swordsman  and he will trust to killing me in time to catch it .', 'but i can fence well too  and i think i can keep him in play  at any rate  until the train is lost .', 'then perhaps he may kill me to console his feelings .', 'you understand ', 'very well then  let me introduce you to some charming friends of mine  and leading them quickly across the parade  he presented them to the marquis  s seconds by two very aristocratic names of which they had not previously heard .', 'syme was subject to spasms of singular common sense  not otherwise a part of his character .', 'they were  as he said of his impulse about the spectacles  poetic intuitions  and they sometimes rose to the exaltation of prophecy .', 'he had correctly calculated in this case the policy of his opponent .', 'when the marquis was informed by his seconds that syme could only fight in the morning  he must fully have realised that an obstacle had suddenly arisen between him and his bomb  throwing business in the capital .', 'naturally he could not explain this objection to his friends  so he chose the course which syme had predicted .', 'he induced his seconds to settle on a small meadow not far from the railway  and he trusted to the fatality of the first engagement .', 'when he came down very coolly to the field of honour  no one could have guessed that he had any anxiety about a journey  his hands were in his pockets  his straw hat on the back of his head  his handsome face brazen in the sun .', 'but it might have struck a stranger as odd that there appeared in his train  not only his seconds carrying the sword  case  but two of his servants carrying a portmanteau and a luncheon basket .', 'early as was the hour  the sun soaked everything in warmth  and syme was vaguely surprised to see so many spring flowers burning gold and silver in the tall grass in which the whole company stood almost knee  deep .', 'with the exception of the marquis  all the men were in sombre and solemn morning  dress  with hats like black chimney  pots  the little doctor especially  with the addition of his black spectacles  looked like an undertaker in a farce .', 'syme could not help feeling a comic contrast between this funereal church parade of apparel and the rich and glistening meadow  growing wild flowers everywhere .', 'but  indeed  this comic contrast between the yellow blossoms and the black hats was but a symbol of the tragic contrast between the yellow blossoms and the black business .', 'on his right was a little wood  far away to his left lay the long curve of the railway line  which he was  so to speak  guarding from the marquis  whose goal and escape it was .', 'in front of him  behind the black group of his opponents  he could see  like a tinted cloud  a small almond bush in flower against the faint line of the sea .', 'the member of the legion of honour  whose name it seemed was colonel ducroix  approached the professor and dr . bull with great politeness  and suggested that the play should terminate with the first considerable hurt .', 'dr . bull  however  having been carefully coached by syme upon this point of policy  insisted  with great dignity and in very bad french  that it should continue until one of the combatants was disabled .', 'syme had made up his mind that he could avoid disabling the marquis and prevent the marquis from disabling him for at least twenty minutes .', 'in twenty minutes the paris train would have gone by .', ' to a man of the well  known skill and valour of monsieur de st . eustache  said the professor solemnly   it must be a matter of indifference which method is adopted  and our principal has strong reasons for demanding the longer encounter  reasons the delicacy of which prevent me from being explicit  but for the just and honourable nature of which i can ', ' peste ', 'broke from the marquis behind  whose face had suddenly darkened   let us stop talking and begin  and he slashed off the head of a tall flower with his stick .', 'syme understood his rude impatience and instinctively looked over his shoulder to see whether the train was coming in sight .', 'but there was no smoke on the horizon .', 'colonel ducroix knelt down and unlocked the case  taking out a pair of twin swords  which took the sunlight and turned to two streaks of white fire .', 'he offered one to the marquis  who snatched it without ceremony  and another to syme  who took it  bent it  and poised it with as much delay as was consistent with dignity .', 'then the colonel took out another pair of blades  and taking one himself and giving another to dr . bull  proceeded to place the men .', 'both combatants had thrown off their coats and waistcoats  and stood sword in hand .', 'the seconds stood on each side of the line of fight with drawn swords also  but still sombre in their dark frock  coats and hats .', 'the principals saluted .', 'the colonel said quietly   engage ', 'and the two blades touched and tingled .', 'when the jar of the joined iron ran up syme  s arm  all the fantastic fears that have been the subject of this story fell from him like dreams from a man waking up in bed .', 'he remembered them clearly and in order as mere delusions of the nerves  how the fear of the professor had been the fear of the tyrannic accidents of nightmare  and how the fear of the doctor had been the fear of the airless vacuum of science .', 'the first was the old fear that any miracle might happen  the second the more hopeless modern fear that no miracle can ever happen .', 'but he saw that these fears were fancies  for he found himself in the presence of the great fact of the fear of death  with its coarse and pitiless common sense .', 'he felt like a man who had dreamed all night of falling over precipices  and had woke up on the morning when he was to be hanged .', 'for as soon as he had seen the sunlight run down the channel of his foe  s foreshortened blade  and as soon as he had felt the two tongues of steel touch  vibrating like two living things  he knew that his enemy was a terrible fighter  and that probably his last hour had come .', 'he felt a strange and vivid value in all the earth around him  in the grass under his feet  he felt the love of life in all living things .', 'he could almost fancy that he heard the grass growing  he could almost fancy that even as he stood fresh flowers were springing up and breaking into blossom in the meadow  flowers blood red and burning gold and blue  fulfilling the whole pageant of the spring .', 'and whenever his eyes strayed for a flash from the calm  staring  hypnotic eyes of the marquis  they saw the little tuft of almond tree against the sky  line .', 'he had the feeling that if by some miracle he escaped he would be ready to sit for ever before that almond tree  desiring nothing else in the world .', 'but while earth and sky and everything had the living beauty of a thing lost  the other half of his head was as clear as glass  and he was parrying his enemy  s point with a kind of clockwork skill of which he had hardly supposed himself capable .', 'once his enemy  s point ran along his wrist  leaving a slight streak of blood  but it either was not noticed or was tacitly ignored .', 'every now and then he riposted  and once or twice he could almost fancy that he felt his point go home  but as there was no blood on blade or shirt he supposed he was mistaken .', 'then came an interruption and a change .', 'at the risk of losing all  the marquis  interrupting his quiet stare  flashed one glance over his shoulder at the line of railway on his right .', 'then he turned on syme a face transfigured to that of a fiend  and began to fight as if with twenty weapons .', 'the attack came so fast and furious  that the one shining sword seemed a shower of shining arrows .', 'syme had no chance to look at the railway  but also he had no need .', 'he could guess the reason of the marquis  s sudden madness of battle  the paris train was in sight .', 'but the marquis  s morbid energy over  reached itself .', 'twice syme  parrying  knocked his opponent  s point far out of the fighting circle  and the third time his riposte was so rapid  that there was no doubt about the hit this time .', 'syme  s sword actually bent under the weight of the marquis  s body  which it had pierced .', 'syme was as certain that he had stuck his blade into his enemy as a gardener that he has stuck his spade into the ground .', 'yet the marquis sprang back from the stroke without a stagger  and syme stood staring at his own sword  point like an idiot .', 'there was no blood on it at all .', 'there was an instant of rigid silence  and then syme in his turn fell furiously on the other  filled with a flaming curiosity .', 'the marquis was probably  in a general sense  a better fencer than he  as he had surmised at the beginning  but at the moment the marquis seemed distraught and at a disadvantage .', 'he fought wildly and even weakly  and he constantly looked away at the railway line  almost as if he feared the train more than the pointed steel .', 'syme  on the other hand  fought fiercely but still carefully  in an intellectual fury  eager to solve the riddle of his own bloodless sword .', 'for this purpose  he aimed less at the marquis  s body  and more at his throat and head .', 'a minute and a half afterwards he felt his point enter the man  s neck below the jaw .', 'it came out clean .', 'half mad  he thrust again  and made what should have been a bloody scar on the marquis  s cheek .', 'but there was no scar .', 'for one moment the heaven of syme again grew black with supernatural terrors .', 'surely the man had a charmed life .', 'but this new spiritual dread was a more awful thing than had been the mere spiritual topsy  turvydom symbolised by the paralytic who pursued him .', 'the professor was only a goblin  this man was a devil  perhaps he was the devil ', 'anyhow  this was certain  that three times had a human sword been driven into him and made no mark .', 'when syme had that thought he drew himself up  and all that was good in him sang high up in the air as a high wind sings in the trees .', 'he thought of all the human things in his story  of the chinese lanterns in saffron park  of the girl  s red hair in the garden  of the honest  beer  swilling sailors down by the dock  of his loyal companions standing by .', 'perhaps he had been chosen as a champion of all these fresh and kindly things to cross swords with the enemy of all creation .', ' after all  he said to himself   i am more than a devil  i am a man .', 'i can do the one thing which satan himself cannot do  i can die  and as the word went through his head  he heard a faint and far  off hoot  which would soon be the roar of the paris train .', 'he fell to fighting again with a supernatural levity  like a mohammedan panting for paradise .', 'as the train came nearer and nearer he fancied he could see people putting up the floral arches in paris  he joined in the growing noise and the glory of the great republic whose gate he was guarding against hell .', 'his thoughts rose higher and higher with the rising roar of the train  which ended  as if proudly  in a long and piercing whistle .', 'the train stopped .', 'suddenly  to the astonishment of everyone the marquis sprang back quite out of sword reach and threw down his sword .', 'the leap was wonderful  and not the less wonderful because syme had plunged his sword a moment before into the man  s thigh .', ' stop ', 'said the marquis in a voice that compelled a momentary obedience .', ' i want to say something .', ' what is the matter ', 'asked colonel ducroix  staring .', ' has there been foul play ', ' there has been foul play somewhere  said dr . bull  who was a little pale .', ' our principal has wounded the marquis four times at least  and he is none the worse .', 'the marquis put up his hand with a curious air of ghastly patience .', ' please let me speak  he said .', ' it is rather important .', 'mr . syme  he continued  turning to his opponent   we are fighting today  if i remember right  because you expressed a wish  which i thought irrational  to pull my nose .', 'would you oblige me by pulling my nose now as quickly as possible ', 'i have to catch a train .', ' i protest that this is most irregular  said dr . bull indignantly .', ' it is certainly somewhat opposed to precedent  said colonel ducroix  looking wistfully at his principal .', ' there is  i think  one case on record  captain bellegarde and the baron zumpt  in which the weapons were changed in the middle of the encounter at the request of one of the combatants .', 'but one can hardly call one  s nose a weapon .', ' will you or will you not pull my nose ', 'said the marquis in exasperation .', ' come  come  mr . syme ', 'you wanted to do it  do it ', 'you can have no conception of how important it is to me .', 'don  t be so selfish ', 'pull my nose at once  when i ask you ', 'and he bent slightly forward with a fascinating smile .', 'the paris train  panting and groaning  had grated into a little station behind the neighbouring hill .', 'syme had the feeling he had more than once had in these adventures  the sense that a horrible and sublime wave lifted to heaven was just toppling over .', 'walking in a world he half understood  he took two paces forward and seized the roman nose of this remarkable nobleman .', 'he pulled it hard  and it came off in his hand .', 'he stood for some seconds with a foolish solemnity  with the pasteboard proboscis still between his fingers  looking at it  while the sun and the clouds and the wooded hills looked down upon this imbecile scene .', 'the marquis broke the silence in a loud and cheerful voice .', ' if anyone has any use for my left eyebrow  he said   he can have it .', 'colonel ducroix  do accept my left eyebrow ', 'it  s the kind of thing that might come in useful any day  and he gravely tore off one of his swarthy assyrian brows  bringing about half his brown forehead with it  and politely offered it to the colonel  who stood crimson and speechless with rage .', ' if i had known  he spluttered   that i was acting for a poltroon who pads himself to fight ', ' oh  i know  i know ', 'said the marquis  recklessly throwing various parts of himself right and left about the field .', ' you are making a mistake  but it can  t be explained just now .', 'i tell you the train has come into the station ', ' yes  said dr . bull fiercely   and the train shall go out of the station .', 'it shall go out without you .', 'we know well enough for what devil  s work ', 'the mysterious marquis lifted his hands with a desperate gesture .', 'he was a strange scarecrow standing there in the sun with half his old face peeled off  and half another face glaring and grinning from underneath .', ' will you drive me mad ', 'he cried .', ' the train ', ' you shall not go by the train  said syme firmly  and grasped his sword .', 'the wild figure turned towards syme  and seemed to be gathering itself for a sublime effort before speaking .', ' you great fat  blasted  blear  eyed  blundering  thundering  brainless  godforsaken

blazes  roared the other   should i want to go by the train ', ' we know all  said the professor sternly .', ' you are going to paris to throw a bomb ', ' going to jericho to throw a jabberwock ', 'cried the other  tearing his hair  which came off easily .', ' have you all got softening of the brain  that you don  t realise what i am ', 'did you really think i wanted to catch that train ', 'twenty paris trains might go by for me .', 'damn paris trains ', ' then what did you care about ', 'began the professor .', ' what did i care about ', 'i didn  t care about catching the train  i cared about whether the train caught me  and now  by god ', 'it has caught me .', ' i regret to inform you  said syme with restraint   that your remarks convey no impression to my mind .', 'perhaps if you were to remove the remains of your original forehead and some portion of what was once your chin  your meaning would become clearer .', 'mental lucidity fulfils itself in many ways .', 'what do you mean by saying that the train has caught you ', 'it may be my literary fancy  but somehow i feel that it ought to mean something .', ' it means everything  said the other   and the end of everything .', 'sunday has us now in the hollow of his hand .', ' us ', 'repeated the professor  as if stupefied .', ' what do you mean by  us ', ' the police  of course ', 'said the marquis  and tore off his scalp and half his face .', 'the head which emerged was the blonde  well brushed  smooth  haired head which is common in the english constabulary  but the face was terribly pale .', ' i am inspector ratcliffe  he said  with a sort of haste that verged on harshness .', ' my name is pretty well known to the police  and i can see well enough that you belong to them .', 'but if there is any doubt about my position  i have a card  and he began to pull a blue card from his pocket .', 'the professor gave a tired gesture .', ' oh  don  t show it us  he said wearily   we  ve got enough of them to equip a paper  chase .', 'the little man named bull  had  like many men who seem to be of a mere vivacious vulgarity  sudden movements of good taste .', 'here he certainly saved the situation .', 'in the midst of this staggering transformation scene he stepped forward with all the gravity and responsibility of a second  and addressed the two seconds of the marquis .', ' gentlemen  he said   we all owe you a serious apology  but i assure you that you have not been made the victims of such a low joke as you imagine  or indeed of anything undignified in a man of honour .', 'you have not wasted your time  you have helped to save the world .', 'we are not buffoons  but very desperate men at war with a vast conspiracy .', 'a secret society of anarchists is hunting us like hares  not such unfortunate madmen as may here or there throw a bomb through starvation or german philosophy  but a rich and powerful and fanatical church  a church of eastern pessimism  which holds it holy to destroy mankind like vermin .', 'how hard they hunt us you can gather from the fact that we are driven to such disguises as those for which i apologise  and to such pranks as this one by which you suffer . ', 'the younger second of the marquis  a short man with a black moustache  bowed politely  and said ', ' of course  i accept the apology  but you will in your turn forgive me if i decline to follow you further into your difficulties  and permit myself to say good morning ', 'the sight of an acquaintance and distinguished fellow  townsman coming to pieces in the open air is unusual  and  upon the whole  sufficient for one day .', 'colonel ducroix  i would in no way influence your actions  but if you feel with me that our present society is a little abnormal  i am now going to walk back to the town .', 'colonel ducroix moved mechanically  but then tugged abruptly at his white moustache and broke out ', ' no  by george ', 'i won  t .', 'if these gentlemen are really in a mess with a lot of low wreckers like that  i  ll see them through it .', 'i have fought for france  and it is hard if i can  t fight for civilization .', 'dr . bull took off his hat and waved it  cheering as at a public meeting .', ' don  t make too much noise  said inspector ratcliffe   sunday may hear you .', ' sunday ', 'cried bull  and dropped his hat .', ' yes  retorted ratcliffe   he may be with them .', ' with whom ', 'asked syme .', ' with the people out of that train  said the other .', ' what you say seems utterly wild  began syme .', ' why  as a matter of fact  but  my god  he cried out suddenly  like a man who sees an explosion a long way off   by god ', 'if this is true the whole bally lot of us on the anarchist council were against anarchy ', 'every born man was a detective except the president and his personal secretary .', 'what can it mean ', ' mean ', 'said the new policeman with incredible violence .', ' it means that we are struck dead ', 'don  t you know sunday ', 'don  t you know that his jokes are always so big and simple that one has never thought of them ', 'can you think of anything more like sunday than this  that he should put all his powerful enemies on the supreme council  and then take care that it was not supreme ', 'i tell you he has bought every trust  he has captured every cable  he has control of every railway line  especially of that railway line ', 'and he pointed a shaking finger towards the small wayside station .', ' the whole movement was controlled by him  half the world was ready to rise for him .', 'but there were just five people  perhaps  who would have resisted him .', '.', '.', 'and the old devil put them on the supreme council  to waste their time in watching each other .', 'idiots that we are  he planned the whole of our idiocies ', 'sunday knew that the professor would chase syme through london  and that syme would fight me in france .', 'and he was combining great masses of capital  and seizing great lines of telegraphy  while we five idiots were running after each other like a lot of confounded babies playing blind man  s buff .', ' well ', 'asked syme with a sort of steadiness .', ' well  replied the other with sudden serenity   he has found us playing blind man  s buff today in a field of great rustic beauty and extreme solitude .', 'he has probably captured the world  it only remains to him to capture this field and all the fools in it .', 'and since you really want to know what was my objection to the arrival of that train  i will tell you .', 'my objection was that sunday or his secretary has just this moment got out of it .', 'syme uttered an involuntary cry  and they all turned their eyes towards the far  off station .', 'it was quite true that a considerable bulk of people seemed to be moving in their direction .', 'but they were too distant to be distinguished in any way .', ' it was a habit of the late marquis de st . eustache  said the new policeman  producing a leather case   always to carry a pair of opera glasses .', 'either the president or the secretary is coming after us with that mob .', 'they have caught us in a nice quiet place where we are under no temptations to break our oaths by calling the police .', 'dr . bull  i have a suspicion that you will see better through these than through your own highly decorative spectacles .', 'he handed the field  glasses to the doctor  who immediately took off his spectacles and put the apparatus to his eyes .', ' it cannot be as bad as you say  said the professor  somewhat shaken .', ' there are a good number of them certainly  but they may easily be ordinary tourists .', ' do ordinary tourists  asked bull  with the fieldglasses to his eyes   wear black masks half  way down the face ', 'syme almost tore the glasses out of his hand  and looked through them .', 'most men in the advancing mob really looked ordinary enough  but it was quite true that two or three of the leaders in front wore black half  masks almost down to their mouths .', 'this disguise is very complete  especially at such a distance  and syme found it impossible to conclude anything from the clean  shaven jaws and chins of the men talking in the front .', 'but presently as they talked they all smiled and one of them smiled on one side .', 'chapter xi', 'the criminals chase the police', 'syme put the field  glasses from his eyes with an almost ghastly relief .', ' the president is not with them  anyhow  he said  and wiped his forehead .', ' but surely they are right away on the horizon  said the bewildered colonel  blinking and but half recovered from bull  s hasty though polite explanation .', ' could you possibly know your president among all those people ', ' could i know a white elephant among all those people ', 'answered syme somewhat irritably .', ' as you very truly say  they are on the horizon  but if he were walking with them .', '.', '.', 'by god ', 'i believe this ground would shake .', 'after an instant  s pause the new man called ratcliffe said with gloomy decision ', ' of course the president isn  t with them .', 'i wish to gemini he were .', 'much more likely the president is riding in triumph through paris  or sitting on the ruins of st . paul  s cathedral .', ' this is absurd ', 'said syme .', ' something may have happened in our absence  but he cannot have carried the world with a rush like that .', 'it is quite true  he added  frowning dubiously at the distant fields that lay towards the little station   it is certainly true that there seems to be a crowd coming this way  but they are not all the army that you make out .', ' oh  they  said the new detective contemptuously   no they are not a very valuable force .', 'but let me tell you frankly that they are precisely calculated to our value  we are not much  my boy  in sunday  s universe .', 'he has got hold of all the cables and telegraphs himself .', 'but to kill the supreme council he regards as a trivial matter  like a post card  it may be left to his private secretary  and he spat on the grass .', 'then he turned to the others and said somewhat austerely ', ' there is a great deal to be said for death  but if anyone has any preference for the other alternative  i strongly advise him to walk after me .', 'with these words  he turned his broad back and strode with silent energy towards the wood .', 'the others gave one glance over their shoulders  and saw that the dark cloud of men had detached itself from the station and was moving with a mysterious discipline across the plain .', 'they saw already  even with the naked eye  black blots on the foremost faces  which marked the masks they wore .', 'they turned and followed their leader  who had already struck the wood  and disappeared among the twinkling trees .', 'the sun on the grass was dry and hot .', 'so in plunging into the wood they had a cool shock of shadow  as of divers who plunge into a dim pool .', 'the inside of the wood was full of shattered sunlight and shaken shadows .', 'they made a sort of shuddering veil  almost recalling the dizziness of a cinematograph .', 'even the solid figures walking with him syme could hardly see for the patterns of sun and shade that danced upon them .', 'now a man  s head was lit as with a light of rembrandt  leaving all else obliterated  now again he had strong and staring white hands with the face of a negro .', 'the ex  marquis had pulled the old straw hat over his eyes  and the black shade of the brim cut his face so squarely in two that it seemed to be wearing one of the black half  masks of their pursuers .', 'the fancy tinted syme  s overwhelming sense of wonder .', 'was he wearing a mask ', 'was anyone wearing a mask ', 'was anyone anything ', 'this wood of witchery  in which men  s faces turned black and white by turns  in which their figures first swelled into sunlight and then faded into formless night  this mere chaos of chiaroscuro  after the clear daylight outside  seemed to syme a perfect symbol of the world in which he had been moving for three days  this world where men took off their beards and their spectacles and their noses  and turned into other people .', 'that tragic self  confidence which he had felt when he believed that the marquis was a devil had strangely disappeared now that he knew that the marquis was a friend .', 'he felt almost inclined to ask after all these bewilderments what was a friend and what an enemy .', 'was there anything that was apart from what it seemed ', 'the marquis had taken off his nose and turned out to be a detective .', 'might he not just as well take off his head and turn out to be a hobgoblin ', 'was not everything  after all  like this bewildering woodland  this dance of dark and light ', 'everything only a glimpse  the glimpse always unforeseen  and always forgotten .', 'for gabriel syme had found in the heart of that sun  splashed wood what many modern painters had found there .', 'he had found the thing which the modern people call impressionism  which is another name for that final scepticism which can find no floor to the universe .', 'as a man in an evil dream strains himself to scream and wake  syme strove with a sudden effort to fling off this last and worst of his fancies .', 'with two impatient strides he overtook the man in the marquis  s straw hat  the man whom he had come to address as ratcliffe .', 'in a voice exaggeratively loud and cheerful  he broke the bottomless silence and made conversation .', ' may i ask  he said   where on earth we are all going to  ', 'so genuine had been the doubts of his soul  that he was quite glad to hear his companion speak in an easy  human voice .', ' we must get down through the town of lancy to the sea  he said .', ' i think that part of the country is least likely to be with them .', ' what can you mean by all this ', 'cried syme .', ' they can  t be running the real world in that way .', 'surely not many working men are anarchists  and surely if they were  mere mobs could not beat modern armies and police .', ' mere mobs ', 'repeated his new friend with a snort of scorn .', ' so you talk about mobs and the working classes as if they were the question .', 'you  ve got that eternal idiotic idea that if anarchy came it would come from the poor .', 'why should it ', 'the poor have been rebels  but they have never been anarchists  they have more interest than anyone else in there being some decent government .', 'the poor man really has a stake in the country .', 'the rich man hasn  t  he can go away to new guinea in a yacht .', 'the poor have sometimes objected to being governed badly  the rich have always objected to being governed at all .', 'aristocrats were always anarchists  as you can see from the barons  wars .', ' as a lecture on english history for the little ones  said syme   this is all very nice  but i have not yet grasped its application .', ' its application is  said his informant   that most of old sunday  s right  hand men are south african and american millionaires .', 'that is why he has got hold of all the communications  and that is why the last four champions of the anti  anarchist police force are running through a wood like rabbits .', ' millionaires i can understand  said syme thoughtfully   they are nearly all mad .', 'but getting hold of a few wicked old gentlemen with hobbies is one thing  getting hold of great christian nations is another .', 'i would bet the nose off my face  forgive the allusion  that sunday would stand perfectly helpless before the task of converting any ordinary healthy person anywhere .', ' well  said the other   it rather depends what sort of person you mean .', ' well  for instance  said syme   he could never convert that person  and he pointed straight in front of him .', 'they had come to an open space of sunlight  which seemed to express to syme the final return of his own good sense  and in the middle of this forest clearing was a figure that might well stand for that common sense in an almost awful actuality .', 'burnt by the sun and stained with perspiration  and grave with the bottomless gravity of small necessary toils  a heavy french peasant was cutting wood with a hatchet .', 'his cart stood a few yards off  already half full of timber  and the horse that cropped the grass was  like his master  valorous but not desperate  like his master  he was even prosperous  but yet was almost sad .', 'the man was a norman  taller than the average of the french and very angular  and his swarthy figure stood dark against a square of sunlight  almost like some allegoric figure of labour frescoed on a ground of gold .', ' mr . syme is saying  called out ratcliffe to the french colonel   that this man  at least  will never be an anarchist .', ' mr . syme is right enough there  answered colonel ducroix  laughing   if only for the reason that he has plenty of property to defend .', 'but i forgot that in your country you are not used to peasants being wealthy .', ' he looks poor  said dr . bull doubtfully .', ' quite so  said the colonel   that is why he is rich .', ' i have an idea  called out dr . bull suddenly   how much would he take to give us a lift in his cart ', 'those dogs are all on foot  and we could soon leave them behind .', ' oh  give him anything ', 'said syme eagerly .', ' i have piles of money on me .', ' that will never do  said the colonel   he will never have any respect for you unless you drive a bargain .', ' oh  if he haggles ', 'began bull impatiently .', ' erie haggles because he is a free man  said the other .', ' you do not understand  he would not see the meaning of generosity .', 'he is not being tipped .', 'and even while they seemed to hear the heavy feet of their strange pursuers behind them  they had to stand and stamp while the french colonel talked to the french wood  cutter with all the leisurely badinage and bickering of market  day .', 'at the end of the four minutes  however  they saw that the colonel was right  for the wood  cutter entered into their plans  not with the vague servility of a tout too  well paid  but with the seriousness of a solicitor who had been paid the proper fee .', 'he told them that the best thing they could do was to make their way down to the little inn on the hills above lancy  where the innkeeper  an old soldier who had become devot in his latter years  would be certain to sympathise with them  and even to take risks in their support .', 'the whole company  therefore  piled themselves on top of the stacks of wood  and went rocking in the rude cart down the other and steeper side of the woodland .', 'heavy and ramshackle as was the vehicle  it was driven quickly enough  and they soon had the exhilarating impression of distancing altogether those  whoever they were  who were hunting them .', 'for  after all  the riddle as to where the anarchists had got all these followers was still unsolved .', 'one man  s presence had sufficed for them  they had fled at the first sight of the deformed smile of the secretary .', 'syme every now and then looked back over his shoulder at the army on their track .', 'as the wood grew first thinner and then smaller with distance  he could see the sunlit slopes beyond it and above it  and across these was still moving the square black mob like one monstrous beetle .', 'in the very strong sunlight and with his own very strong eyes  which were almost telescopic  syme could see this mass of men quite plainly .', 'he could see them as separate human figures  but he was increasingly surprised by the way in which they moved as one man .', 'they seemed to be dressed in dark clothes and plain hats  like any common crowd out of the streets  but they did not spread and sprawl and trail by various lines to the attack  as would be natural in an ordinary mob .', 'they moved with a sort of dreadful and wicked woodenness  like a staring army of automatons .', 'syme pointed this out to ratcliffe .', ' yes  replied the policeman   that  s discipline .', 'that  s sunday .', 'he is perhaps five hundred miles off  but the fear of him is on all of them  like the finger of god .', 'yes  they are walking regularly  and you bet your boots that they are talking regularly  yes  and thinking regularly .', 'but the one important thing for us is that they are disappearing regularly .', 'syme nodded .', 'it was true that the black patch of the pursuing men was growing smaller and smaller as the peasant belaboured his horse .', 'the level of the sunlit landscape  though flat as a whole  fell away on the farther side of the wood in billows of heavy slope towards the sea  in a way not unlike the lower slopes of the sussex downs .', 'the only difference was that in sussex the road would have been broken and angular like a little brook  but here the white french road fell sheer in front of them like a waterfall .', 'down this direct descent the cart clattered at a considerable angle  and in a few minutes  the road growing yet steeper  they saw below them the little harbour of lancy and a great blue arc of the sea .', 'the travelling cloud of their enemies had wholly disappeared from the horizon .', 'the horse and cart took a sharp turn round a clump of elms  and the horse  s nose nearly struck the face of an old gentleman who was sitting on the benches outside the little cafe of  le soleil d  or .', 'the peasant grunted an apology  and got down from his seat .', 'the others also descended one by one  and spoke to the old gentleman with fragmentary phrases of courtesy  for it was quite evident from his expansive manner that he was the owner of the little tavern .', 'he was a white  haired  apple  faced old boy  with sleepy eyes and a grey moustache  stout  sedentary  and very innocent  of a type that may often be found in france  but is still commoner in catholic germany .', 'everything about him  his pipe  his pot of beer  his flowers  and his beehive  suggested an ancestral peace  only when his visitors looked up as they entered the inn  parlour  they saw the sword upon the wall .', 'the colonel  who greeted the innkeeper as an old friend  passed rapidly into the inn  parlour  and sat down ordering some ritual refreshment .', 'the military decision of his action interested syme  who sat next to him  and he took the opportunity when the old innkeeper had gone out of satisfying his curiosity .', ' may i ask you  colonel  he said in a low voice   why we have come here ', 'colonel ducroix smiled behind his bristly white moustache .', ' for two reasons  sir  he said   and i will give first  not the most important  but the most utilitarian .', 'we came here because this is the only place within twenty miles in which we can get horses .', ' horses ', 'repeated syme  looking up quickly .', ' yes  replied the other   if you people are really to distance your enemies it is horses or nothing for you  unless of course you have bicycles and motor  cars in your pocket .', ' and where do you advise us to make for ', 'asked syme doubtfully .', ' beyond question  replied the colonel   you had better make all haste to the police station beyond the town .', 'my friend  whom i seconded under somewhat deceptive circumstances  seems to me to exaggerate very much the possibilities of a general rising  but even he would hardly maintain  i suppose  that you were not safe with the gendarmes .', 'syme nodded gravely  then he said abruptly ', ' and your other reason for coming here ', ' my other reason for coming here  said ducroix soberly   is that it is just as well to see a good man or two when one is possibly near to death .', 'syme looked up at the wall  and saw a crudely  painted and pathetic religious picture .', 'then he said ', ' you are right  and then almost immediately afterwards   has anyone seen about the horses ', ' yes  answered ducroix   you may be quite certain that i gave orders the moment i came in .', 'those enemies of yours gave no impression of hurry  but they were really moving wonderfully fast  like a well  trained army .', 'i had no idea that the anarchists had so much discipline .', 'you have not a moment to waste .', 'almost as he spoke  the old innkeeper with the blue eyes and white hair came ambling into the room  and announced that six horses were saddled outside .', 'by ducroix  s advice the five others equipped themselves with some portable form of food and wine  and keeping their duelling swords as the only weapons available  they clattered away down the steep  white road .', 'the two servants  who had carried the marquis  s luggage when he was a marquis  were left behind to drink at the cafe by common consent  and not at all against their own inclination .', 'by this time the afternoon sun was slanting westward  and by its rays syme could see the sturdy figure of the old innkeeper growing smaller and smaller  but still standing and looking after them quite silently  the sunshine in his silver hair .', 'syme had a fixed  superstitious fancy  left in his mind by the chance phrase of the colonel  that this was indeed  perhaps  the last honest stranger whom he should ever see upon the earth .', 'he was still looking at this dwindling figure  which stood as a mere grey blot touched with a white flame against the great green wall of the steep down behind him .', 'and as he stared over the top of the down behind the innkeeper  there appeared an army of black  clad and marching men .', 'they seemed to hang above the good man and his house like a black cloud of locusts .', 'the horses had been saddled none too soon .', 'chapter xii', 'the earth in anarchy', 'urging the horses to a gallop  without respect to the rather rugged descent of the road  the horsemen soon regained their advantage over the men on the march  and at last the bulk of the first buildings of lancy cut off the sight of their pursuers .', 'nevertheless  the ride had been a long one  and by the time they reached the real town the west was warming with the colour and quality of sunset .', 'the colonel suggested that  before making finally for the police station  they should make the effort  in passing  to attach to themselves one more individual who might be useful .', ' four out of the five rich men in this town  he said   are common swindlers .', 'i suppose the proportion is pretty equal all over the world .', 'the fifth is a friend of mine  and a very fine fellow  and what is even more important from our point of view  he owns a motor  car .', ' i am afraid  said the professor in his mirthful way  looking back along the white road on which the black  crawling patch might appear at any moment   i am afraid we have hardly time for afternoon calls .', ' doctor renard  s house is only three minutes off  said the colonel .', ' our danger  said dr . bull   is not two minutes off .', ' yes  said syme   if we ride on fast we must leave them behind  for they are on foot .', ' he has a motor  car  said the colonel .', ' but we may not get it  said bull .', ' yes  he is quite on your side .', ' but he might be out .', ' hold your tongue  said syme suddenly .', ' what is that noise ', 'for a second they all sat as still as equestrian statues  and for a second  for two or three or four seconds  heaven and earth seemed equally still .', 'then all their ears  in an agony of attention  heard along the road that indescribable thrill and throb that means only one thing  horses ', 'the colonel  s face had an instantaneous change  as if lightning had struck it  and yet left it scatheless .', ' they have done us  he said  with brief military irony .', ' prepare to receive cavalry ', ' where can they have got the horses ', 'asked syme  as he mechanically urged his steed to a canter .', 'the colonel was silent for a little  then he said in a strained voice ', ' i was speaking with strict accuracy when i said that the  soleil d  or  was the only place where one can get horses within twenty miles .', ' no ', 'said syme violently   i don  t believe he  d do it .', 'not with all that white hair .', ' he may have been forced  said the colonel gently .', ' they must be at least a hundred strong  for which reason we are all going to see my friend renard  who has a motor  car .', 'with these words he swung his horse suddenly round a street corner  and went down the street with such thundering speed  that the others  though already well at the gallop  had difficulty in following the flying tail of his horse .', 'dr . renard inhabited a high and comfortable house at the top of a steep street  so that when the riders alighted at his door they could once more see the solid green ridge of the hill  with the white road across it  standing up above all the roofs of the town .', 'they breathed again to see that the road as yet was clear  and they rang the bell .', 'dr . renard was a beaming  brown  bearded man  a good example of that silent but very busy professional class which france has preserved even more perfectly than england .', 'when the matter was explained to him he pooh  poohed the panic of the ex  marquis altogether  he said  with the solid french scepticism  that there was no conceivable probability of a general anarchist rising .', ' anarchy  he said  shrugging his shoulders   it is childishness ', ' et ca  cried out the colonel suddenly  pointing over the other  s shoulder   and that is childishness  isn  t it ', 'they all looked round  and saw a curve of black cavalry come sweeping over the top of the hill with all the energy of attila .', 'swiftly as they rode  however  the whole rank still kept well together  and they could see the black vizards of the first line as level as a line of uniforms .', 'but although the main black square was the same  though travelling faster  there was now one sensational difference which they could see clearly upon the slope of the hill  as if upon a slanted map .', 'the bulk of the riders were in one block  but one rider flew far ahead of the column  and with frantic movements of hand and heel urged his horse faster and faster  so that one might have fancied that he was not the pursuer but the pursued .', 'but even at that great distance they could see something so fanatical  so unquestionable in his figure  that they knew it was the secretary himself .', ' i am sorry to cut short a cultured discussion  said the colonel   but can you lend me your motor  car now  in two minutes ', ' i have a suspicion that you are all mad  said dr . renard  smiling sociably   but god forbid that madness should in any way interrupt friendship .', 'let us go round to the garage .', 'dr . renard was a mild man with monstrous wealth  his rooms were like the musee de cluny  and he had three motor  cars .', 'these  however  he seemed to use very sparingly  having the simple tastes of the french middle class  and when his impatient friends came to examine them  it took them some time to assure themselves that one of them even could be made to work .', 'this with some difficulty they brought round into the street before the doctor  s house .', 'when they came out of the dim garage they were startled to find that twilight had already fallen with the abruptness of night in the tropics .', 'either they had been longer in the place than they imagined  or some unusual canopy of cloud had gathered over the town .', 'they looked down the steep streets  and seemed to see a slight mist coming up from the sea .', ' it is now or never  said dr . bull .', ' i hear horses .', ' no  corrected the professor   a horse .', 'and as they listened  it was evident that the noise  rapidly coming nearer on the rattling stones  was not the noise of the whole cavalcade but that of the one horseman  who had left it far behind  the insane secretary .', 'syme  s family  like most of those who end in the simple life  had once owned a motor  and he knew all about them .', 'he had leapt at once into the chauffeur  s seat  and with flushed face was wrenching and tugging at the disused machinery .', 'he bent his strength upon one handle  and then said quite quietly ', ' i am afraid it  s no go .', 'as he spoke  there swept round the corner a man rigid on his rushing horse  with the rush and rigidity of an arrow .', 'he had a smile that thrust out his chin as if it were dislocated .', 'he swept alongside of the stationary car  into which its company had crowded  and laid his hand on the front .', 'it was the secretary  and his mouth went quite straight in the solemnity of triumph .', 'syme was leaning hard upon the steering wheel  and there was no sound but the rumble of the other pursuers riding into the town .', 'then there came quite suddenly a scream of scraping iron  and the car leapt forward .', 'it plucked the secretary clean out of his saddle  as a knife is whipped out of its sheath  trailed him kicking terribly for twenty yards  and left him flung flat upon the road far in front of his frightened horse .', 'as the car took the corner of the street with a splendid curve  they could just see the other anarchists filling the street and raising their fallen leader .', ' i can  t understand why it has grown so dark  said the professor at last in a low voice .', ' going to be a storm  i think  said dr . bull .', ' i say  it  s a pity we haven  t got a light on this car  if only to see by .', ' we have  said the colonel  and from the floor of the car he fished up a heavy  old  fashioned  carved iron lantern with a light inside it .', 'it was obviously an antique  and it would seem as if its original use had been in some way semi  religious  for there was a rude moulding of a cross upon one of its sides .', ' where on earth did you get that ', 'asked the professor .', ' i got it where i got the car  answered the colonel  chuckling   from my best friend .', 'while our friend here was fighting with the steering wheel  i ran up the front steps of the house and spoke to renard  who was standing in his own porch  you will remember .', ' i suppose  i said   there  s no time to get a lamp .', 'he looked up  blinking amiably at the beautiful arched ceiling of his own front hall .', 'from this was suspended  by chains of exquisite ironwork  this lantern  one of the hundred treasures of his treasure house .', 'by sheer force he tore the lamp out of his own ceiling  shattering the painted panels  and bringing down two blue vases with his violence .', 'then he handed me the iron lantern  and i put it in the car .', 'was i not right when i said that dr . renard was worth knowing ', ' you were  said syme seriously  and hung the heavy lantern over the front .', 'there was a certain allegory of their whole position in the contrast between the modern automobile and its strange ecclesiastical lamp .', 'hitherto they had passed through the quietest part of the town  meeting at most one or two pedestrians  who could give them no hint of the peace or the hostility of the place .', 'now  however  the windows in the houses began one by one to be lit up  giving a greater sense of habitation and humanity .', 'dr . bull turned to the new detective who had led their flight  and permitted himself one of his natural and friendly smiles .', ' these lights make one feel more cheerful .', 'inspector ratcliffe drew his brows together .', ' there is only one set of lights that make me more cheerful  he said   and they are those lights of the police station which i can see beyond the town .', 'please god we may be there in ten minutes .', 'then all bull  s boiling good sense and optimism broke suddenly out of him .', ' oh  this is all raving nonsense ', 'he cried .', ' if you really think that ordinary people in ordinary houses are anarchists  you must be madder than an anarchist yourself .', 'if we turned and fought these fellows  the whole town would fight for us .', ' no  said the other with an immovable simplicity   the whole town would fight for them .', 'we shall see .', 'while they were speaking the professor had leant forward with sudden excitement .', ' what is that noise ', 'he said .', ' oh  the horses behind us  i suppose  said the colonel .', ' i thought we had got clear of them .', ' the horses behind us ', 'no  said the professor   it is not horses  and it is not behind us .', 'almost as he spoke  across the end of the street before them two shining and rattling shapes shot past .', 'they were gone almost in a flash  but everyone could see that they were motor  cars  and the professor stood up with a pale face and swore that they were the other two motor  cars from dr . renard  s garage .', ' i tell you they were his  he repeated  with wild eyes   and they were full of men in masks ', ' absurd ', 'said the colonel angrily .', ' dr . renard would never give them his cars .', ' he may have been forced  said ratcliffe quietly .', ' the whole town is on their side .', ' you still believe that  asked the colonel incredulously .', ' you will all believe it soon  said the other with a hopeless calm .', 'there was a puzzled pause for some little time  and then the colonel began again abruptly ', ' no  i can  t believe it .', 'the thing is nonsense .', 'the plain people of a peaceable french town ', 'he was cut short by a bang and a blaze of light  which seemed close to his eyes .', 'as the car sped on it left a floating patch of white smoke behind it  and syme had heard a shot shriek past his ear .', ' my god ', 'said the colonel   someone has shot at us .', ' it need not interrupt conversation  said the gloomy ratcliffe .', ' pray resume your remarks  colonel .', 'you were talking  i think  about the plain people of a peaceable french town .', 'the staring colonel was long past minding satire .', 'he rolled his eyes all round the street .', ' it is extraordinary  he said   most extraordinary .', ' a fastidious person  said syme   might even call it unpleasant .', 'however  i suppose those lights out in the field beyond this street are the gendarmerie .', 'we shall soon get there .', ' no  said inspector ratcliffe   we shall never get there .', 'he had been standing up and looking keenly ahead of him .', 'now he sat down and smoothed his sleek hair with a weary gesture .', ' what do you mean ', 'asked bull sharply .', ' i mean that we shall never get there  said the pessimist placidly .', ' they have two rows of armed men across the road already  i can see them from here .', 'the town is in arms  as i said it was .', 'i can only wallow in the exquisite comfort of my own exactitude .', 'and ratcliffe sat down comfortably in the car and lit a cigarette  but the others rose excitedly and stared down the road .', 'syme had slowed down the car as their plans became doubtful  and he brought it finally to a standstill just at the corner of a side street that ran down very steeply to the sea .', 'the town was mostly in shadow  but the sun had not sunk  wherever its level light could break through  it painted everything a burning gold .', 'up this side street the last sunset light shone as sharp and narrow as the shaft of artificial light at the theatre .', 'it struck the car of the five friends  and lit it like a burning chariot .', 'but the rest of the street  especially the two ends of it  was in the deepest twilight  and for some seconds they could see nothing .', 'then syme  whose eyes were the keenest  broke into a little bitter whistle  and said', ' it is quite true .', 'there is a crowd or an army or some such thing across the end of that street .', ' well  if there is  said bull impatiently   it must be something else  a sham fight or the mayor  s birthday or something .', 'i cannot and will not believe that plain  jolly people in a place like this walk about with dynamite in their pockets .', 'get on a bit  syme  and let us look at them .', 'the car crawled about a hundred yards farther  and then they were all startled by dr . bull breaking into a high crow of laughter .', ' why  you silly mugs ', 'he cried   what did i tell you .', 'that crowd  s as law  abiding as a cow  and if it weren  t  it  s on our side .', ' how do you know ', 'asked the professor  staring .', ' you blind bat  cried bull   don  t you see who is leading them ', 'they peered again  and then the colonel  with a catch in his voice  cried out ', ' why  it  s renard ', 'there was  indeed  a rank of dim figures running across the road  and they could not be clearly seen  but far enough in front to catch the accident of the evening light was stalking up and down the unmistakable dr . renard  in a white hat  stroking his long brown beard  and holding a revolver in his left hand .', ' what a fool i  ve been ', 'exclaimed the colonel .', ' of course  the dear old boy has turned out to help us .', 'dr . bull was bubbling over with laughter  swinging the sword in his hand as carelessly as a cane .', 'he jumped out of the car and ran across the intervening space  calling out ', ' dr . renard ', 'dr .', 'renard ', 'an instant after syme thought his own eyes had gone mad in his head .', 'for the philanthropic dr . renard had deliberately raised his revolver and fired twice at bull  so that the shots rang down the road .', 'almost at the same second as the puff of white cloud went up from this atrocious explosion a long puff of white cloud went up also from the cigarette of the cynical ratcliffe .', 'like all the rest he turned a little pale  but he smiled .', 'dr . bull  at whom the bullets had been fired  just missing his scalp  stood quite still in the middle of the road without a sign of fear  and then turned very slowly and crawled back to the car  and climbed in with two holes through his hat .', ' well  said the cigarette smoker slowly   what do you think now ', ' i think  said dr . bull with precision   that i am lying in bed at no .', ' peabody buildings  and that i shall soon wake up with a jump  or  if that  s not it  i think that i am sitting in a small cushioned cell in hanwell  and that the doctor can  t make much of my case .', 'but if you want to know what i don  t think  i  ll tell you .', 'i don  t think what you think .', 'i don  t think  and i never shall think  that the mass of ordinary men are a pack of dirty modern thinkers .', 'no  sir  i  m a democrat  and i still don  t believe that sunday could convert one average navvy or counter  jumper .', 'no  i may be mad  but humanity isn  t .', 'syme turned his bright blue eyes on bull with an earnestness which he did not commonly make clear .', ' you are a very fine fellow  he said .', ' you can believe in a sanity which is not merely your sanity .', 'and you  re right enough about humanity  about peasants and people like that jolly old innkeeper .', 'but you  re not right about renard .', 'i suspected him from the first .', 'he  s rationalistic  and  what  s worse  he  s rich .', 'when duty and religion are really destroyed  it will be by the rich .', ' they are really destroyed now  said the man with a cigarette  and rose with his hands in his pockets .', ' the devils are coming on ', 'the men in the motor  car looked anxiously in the direction of his dreamy gaze  and they saw that the whole regiment at the end of the road was advancing upon them  dr . renard marching furiously in front  his beard flying in the breeze .', 'the colonel sprang out of the car with an intolerant exclamation .', ' gentlemen  he cried   the thing is incredible .', 'it must be a practical joke .', 'if you knew renard as i do  it  s like calling queen victoria a dynamiter .', 'if you had got the man  s character into your head ', ' dr . bull  said syme sardonically   has at least got it into his hat .', ' i tell you it can  t be ', 'cried the colonel  stamping .', ' renard shall explain it .', 'he shall explain it to me  and he strode forward .', ' don  t be in such a hurry  drawled the smoker .', ' he will very soon explain it to all of us .', 'but the impatient colonel was already out of earshot  advancing towards the advancing enemy .', 'the excited dr . renard lifted his pistol again  but perceiving his opponent  hesitated  and the colonel came face to face with him with frantic gestures of remonstrance .', ' it is no good  said syme .', ' he will never get anything out of that old heathen .', 'i vote we drive bang through the thick of them  bang as the bullets went through bull  s hat .', 'we may all be killed  but we must kill a tidy number of them .', ' i won  t  ave it  said dr . bull  growing more vulgar in the sincerity of his virtue .', ' the poor chaps may be making a mistake .', 'give the colonel a chance .', ' shall we go back  then ', 'asked the professor .', ' no  said ratcliffe in a cold voice   the street behind us is held too .', 'in fact  i seem to see there another friend of yours  syme .', 'syme spun round smartly  and stared backwards at the track which they had travelled .', 'he saw an irregular body of horsemen gathering and galloping towards them in the gloom .', 'he saw above the foremost saddle the silver gleam of a sword  and then as it grew nearer the silver gleam of an old man  s hair .', 'the next moment  with shattering violence  he had swung the motor round and sent it dashing down the steep side street to the sea  like a man that desired only to die .', ' what the devil is up ', 'cried the professor  seizing his arm .', ' the morning star has fallen ', 'said syme  as his own car went down the darkness like a falling star .', 'the others did not understand his words  but when they looked back at the street above they saw the hostile cavalry coming round the corner and down the slopes after them  and foremost of all rode the good innkeeper  flushed with the fiery innocence of the evening light .', ' the world is insane ', 'said the professor  and buried his face in his hands .', ' no  said dr . bull in adamantine humility   it is i .', ' what are we going to do ', 'asked the professor .', ' at this moment  said syme  with a scientific detachment   i think we are going to smash into a lamppost .', 'the next instant the automobile had come with a catastrophic jar against an iron object .', 'the instant after that four men had crawled out from under a chaos of metal  and a tall lean lamp  post that had stood up straight on the edge of the marine parade stood out  bent and twisted  like the branch of a broken tree .', ' well  we smashed something  said the professor  with a faint smile .', ' that  s some comfort .', ' you  re becoming an anarchist  said syme  dusting his clothes with his instinct of daintiness .', ' everyone is  said ratcliffe .', 'as they spoke  the white  haired horseman and his followers came thundering from above  and almost at the same moment a dark string of men ran shouting along the sea  front .', 'syme snatched a sword  and took it in his teeth  he stuck two others under his arm  pits  took a fourth in his left hand and the lantern in his right  and leapt off the high parade on to the beach below .', 'the others leapt after him  with a common acceptance of such decisive action  leaving the debris and the gathering mob above them .', ' we have one more chance  said syme  taking the steel out of his mouth .', ' whatever all this pandemonium means  i suppose the police station will help us .', 'we can  t get there  for they hold the way .', 'but there  s a pier or breakwater runs out into the sea just here  which we could defend longer than anything else  like horatius and his bridge .', 'we must defend it till the gendarmerie turn out .', 'keep after me .', 'they followed him as he went crunching down the beach  and in a second or two their boots broke not on the sea gravel  but on broad  flat stones .', 'they marched down a long  low jetty  running out in one arm into the dim  boiling sea  and when they came to the end of it they felt that they had come to the end of their story .', 'they turned and faced the town .', 'that town was transfigured with uproar .', 'all along the high parade from which they had just descended was a dark and roaring stream of humanity  with tossing arms and fiery faces  groping and glaring towards them .', 'the long dark line was dotted with torches and lanterns  but even where no flame lit up a furious face  they could see in the farthest figure  in the most shadowy gesture  an organised hate .', 'it was clear that they were the accursed of all men  and they knew not why .', 'two or three men  looking little and black like monkeys  leapt over the edge as they had done and dropped on to the beach .', 'these came ploughing down the deep sand  shouting horribly  and strove to wade into the sea at random .', 'the example was followed  and the whole black mass of men began to run and drip over the edge like black treacle .', 'foremost among the men on the beach syme saw the peasant who had driven their cart .', 'he splashed into the surf on a huge cart  horse  and shook his axe at them .', ' the peasant ', 'cried syme .', ' they have not risen since the middle ages .', ' even if the police do come now  said the professor mournfully   they can do nothing with this mob .', ' nonsence ', 'said bull desperately   there must be some people left in the town who are human .', ' no  said the hopeless inspector   the human being will soon be extinct .', 'we are the last of mankind .', ' it may be  said the professor absently .', 'then he added in his dreamy voice   what is all that at the end of the  dunciad ', ' nor public flame  nor private  dares to shine  nor human light is left  nor glimpse divine ', 'lo ', 'thy dread empire  chaos  is restored  light dies before thine uncreating word  thy hand  great anarch  lets the curtain fall  and universal darkness buries all .', ' stop ', 'cried bull suddenly   the gendarmes are out .', 'the low lights of the police station were indeed blotted and broken with hurrying figures  and they heard through the darkness the clash and jingle of a disciplined cavalry .', ' they are charging the mob ', 'cried bull in ecstacy or alarm .', ' no  said syme   they are formed along the parade .', ' they have unslung their carbines  cried bull dancing with excitement .', ' yes  said ratcliffe   and they are going to fire on us .', 'as he spoke there came a long crackle of musketry  and bullets seemed to hop like hailstones on the stones in front of them .', ' the gendarmes have joined them ', 'cried the professor  and struck his forehead .', ' i am in the padded cell  said bull solidly .', 'there was a long silence  and then ratcliffe said  looking out over the swollen sea  all a sort of grey purple ', ' what does it matter who is mad or who is sane ', 'we shall all be dead soon .', 'syme turned to him and said ', ' you are quite hopeless  then ', 'mr . ratcliffe kept a stony silence  then at last he said quietly ', ' no  oddly enough i am not quite hopeless .', 'there is one insane little hope that i cannot get out of my mind .', 'the power of this whole planet is against us  yet i cannot help wondering whether this one silly little hope is hopeless yet .', ' in what or whom is your hope ', 'asked syme with curiosity .', ' in a man i never saw  said the other  looking at the leaden sea .', ' i know what you mean  said syme in a low voice   the man in the dark room .', 'but sunday must have killed him by now .', ' perhaps  said the other steadily   but if so  he was the only man whom sunday found it hard to kill .', ' i heard what you said  said the professor  with his back turned .', ' i also am holding hard on to the thing i never saw .', 'all of a sudden syme  who was standing as if blind with introspective thought  swung round and cried out  like a man waking from sleep ', ' where is the colonel ', 'i thought he was with us ', ' the colonel ', 'yes  cried bull   where on earth is the colonel ', ' he went to speak to renard  said the professor .', ' we cannot leave him among all those beasts  cried syme .', ' let us die like gentlemen if ', ' do not pity the colonel  said ratcliffe  with a pale sneer .', ' he is extremely comfortable .', 'he is ', ' no ', 'no ', 'no ', 'cried syme in a kind of frenzy   not the colonel too ', 'i will never believe it ', ' will you believe your eyes ', 'asked the other  and pointed to the beach .', 'many of their pursuers had waded into the water shaking their fists  but the sea was rough  and they could not reach the pier .', 'two or three figures  however  stood on the beginning of the stone footway  and seemed to be cautiously advancing down it .', 'the glare of a chance lantern lit up the faces of the two foremost .', 'one face wore a black half  mask  and under it the mouth was twisting about in such a madness of nerves that the black tuft of beard wriggled round and round like a restless  living thing .', 'the other was the red face and white moustache of colonel ducroix .', 'they were in earnest consultation .', ' yes  he is gone too  said the professor  and sat down on a stone .', ' everything  s gone .', 'i  m gone ', 'i can  t trust my own bodily machinery .', 'i feel as if my own hand might fly up and strike me .', ' when my hand flies up  said syme   it will strike somebody else  and he strode along the pier towards the colonel  the sword in one hand and the lantern in the other .', 'as if to destroy the last hope or doubt  the colonel  who saw him coming  pointed his revolver at him and fired .', 'the shot missed syme  but struck his sword  breaking it short at the hilt .', 'syme rushed on  and swung the iron lantern above his head .', ' judas before herod ', 'he said  and struck the colonel down upon the stones .', 'then he turned to the secretary  whose frightful mouth was almost foaming now  and held the lamp high with so rigid and arresting a gesture  that the man was  as it were  frozen for a moment  and forced to hear .', ' do you see this lantern ', 'cried syme in a terrible voice .', ' do you see the cross carved on it  and the flame inside ', 'you did not make it .', 'you did not light it  better men than you  men who could believe and obey  twisted the entrails of iron and preserved the legend of fire .', 'there is not a street you walk on  there is not a thread you wear  that was not made as this lantern was  by denying your philosophy of dirt and rats .', 'you can make nothing .', 'you can only destroy .', 'you will destroy mankind  you will destroy the world .', 'let that suffice you .', 'yet this one old christian lantern you shall not destroy .', 'it shall go where your empire of apes will never have the wit to find it .', 'he struck the secretary once with the lantern so that he staggered  and then  whirling it twice round his head  sent it flying far out to sea  where it flared like a roaring rocket and fell .', ' swords ', 'shouted syme  turning his flaming face  to the three behind him .', ' let us charge these dogs  for our time has come to die .', 'his three companions came after him sword in hand .', 'syme  s sword was broken  but he rent a bludgeon from the fist of a fisherman  flinging him down .', 'in a moment they would have flung themselves upon the face of the mob and perished  when an interruption came .', 'the secretary  ever since syme  s speech  had stood with his hand to his stricken head as if dazed  now he suddenly pulled off his black mask .', 'the pale face thus peeled in the lamplight revealed not so much rage as astonishment .', 'he put up his hand with an anxious authority .', ' there is some mistake  he said .', ' mr . syme  i hardly think you understand your position .', 'i arrest you in the name of the law .', ' of the law ', 'said syme  and dropped his stick .', ' certainly ', 'said the secretary .', ' i am a detective from scotland yard  and he took a small blue card from his pocket .', ' and what do you suppose we are ', 'asked the professor  and threw up his arms .', ' you  said the secretary stiffly   are  as i know for a fact  members of the supreme anarchist council .', 'disguised as one of you  i ', 'dr . bull tossed his sword into the sea .', ' there never was any supreme anarchist council  he said .', ' we were all a lot of silly policemen looking at each other .', 'and all these nice people who have been peppering us with shot thought we were the dynamiters .', 'i knew i couldn  t be wrong about the mob  he said  beaming over the enormous multitude  which stretched away to the distance on both sides .', ' vulgar people are never mad .', 'i  m vulgar myself  and i know .', 'i am now going on shore to stand a drink to everybody here .', 'chapter xiii', 'the pursuit of the president', 'next morning five bewildered but hilarious people took the boat for dover .', 'the poor old colonel might have had some cause to complain  having been first forced to fight for two factions that didn  t exist  and then knocked down with an iron lantern .', 'but he was a magnanimous old gentleman  and being much relieved that neither party had anything to do with dynamite  he saw them off on the pier with great geniality .', 'the five reconciled detectives had a hundred details to explain to each other .', 'the secretary had to tell syme how they had come to wear masks originally in order to approach the supposed enemy as fellow  conspirators ', 'syme had to explain how they had fled with such swiftness through a civilised country .', 'but above all these matters of detail which could be explained  rose the central mountain of the matter that they could not explain .', 'what did it all mean ', 'if they were all harmless officers  what was sunday ', 'if he had not seized the world  what on earth had he been up to ', 'inspector ratcliffe was still gloomy about this .', ' i can  t make head or tail of old sunday  s little game any more than you can  he said .', ' but whatever else sunday is  he isn  t a blameless citizen .', 'damn it ', 'do you remember his face ', ' i grant you  answered syme   that i have never been able to forget it .', ' well  said the secretary   i suppose we can find out soon  for tomorrow we have our next general meeting .', 'you will excuse me  he said  with a rather ghastly smile   for being well acquainted with my secretarial duties .', ' i suppose you are right  said the professor reflectively .', ' i suppose we might find it out from him  but i confess that i should feel a bit afraid of asking sunday who he really is .', ' why  asked the secretary   for fear of bombs ', ' no  said the professor   for fear he might tell me .', ' let us have some drinks  said dr . bull  after a silence .', 'throughout their whole journey by boat and train they were highly convivial  but they instinctively kept together .', 'dr . bull  who had always been the optimist of the party  endeavoured to persuade the other four that the whole company could take the same hansom cab from victoria  but this was over  ruled  and they went in a four  wheeler  with dr . bull on the box  singing .', 'they finished their journey at an hotel in piccadilly circus  so as to be close to the early breakfast next morning in leicester square .', 'yet even then the adventures of the day were not entirely over .', 'dr . bull  discontented with the general proposal to go to bed  had strolled out of the hotel at about eleven to see and taste some of the beauties of london .', 'twenty minutes afterwards  however  he came back and made quite a clamour in the hall .', 'syme  who tried at first to soothe him  was forced at last to listen to his communication with quite new attention .', ' i tell you i  ve seen him ', 'said dr . bull  with thick emphasis .', ' whom ', 'asked syme quickly .', ' not the president ', ' not so bad as that  said

sham anarchists who had been exposed .', ' why do you worry with me ', 'he cried .', ' you have expelled me as a spy .', ' we are all spies ', 'whispered syme .', ' we  re all spies ', 'shouted dr . bull .', ' come and have a drink .', 'next morning the battalion of the reunited six marched stolidly towards the hotel in leicester square .', ' this is more cheerful  said dr . bull   we are six men going to ask one man what he means .', ' i think it is a bit queerer than that  said syme .', ' i think it is six men going to ask one man what they mean .', 'they turned in silence into the square  and though the hotel was in the opposite corner  they saw at once the little balcony and a figure that looked too big for it .', 'he was sitting alone with bent head  poring over a newspaper .', 'but all his councillors  who had come to vote him down  crossed that square as if they were watched out of heaven by a hundred eyes .', 'they had disputed much upon their policy  about whether they should leave the unmasked gogol without and begin diplomatically  or whether they should bring him in and blow up the gunpowder at once .', 'the influence of syme and bull prevailed for the latter course

up the dark stair in silence  and they all came out simultaneously into the broad sunlight of the morning and the broad sunlight of sunday  s smile .', ' delightful ', 'he said .', ' so pleased to see you all .', 'what an exquisite day it is .', 'is the czar dead ', 'the secretary  who happened to be foremost  drew himself together for a dignified outburst .', ' no  sir  he said sternly  there has been no massacre .', 'i bring you news of no such disgusting spectacles .', ' disgusting spectacles ', 'repeated the president  with a bright  inquiring smile .', ' you mean dr . bull  s spectacles ',

grows on one  said the president   in fact  it grows on you  and who am i to quarrel with the wild fruits upon the tree of life ', 'i dare say it will grow on me some day .', ' we have no time for tomfoolery  said the secretary  breaking in savagely .', ' we have come to know what all this means .', 'who are you ', 'what are you ', 'why did you get us all here ', 'do you know who and what we are ', 'are you a half  witted man playing the conspirator  or are you a clever man playing the fool ', 'answer me  i tell you .', ' candidates  murmured sunday   are only required to answer eight out of the seventeen questions on the paper .', 'as far as i can make out  you want me to tell you what i am  and what you are  and what this table is  and what this council is  and what this world is for all i know .', 'well  i will go so far as to rend the veil of one mystery .', 'if you want to know what you are  you are a set of highly well  intentioned young jackasses .', ' and you  said syme  leaning forward   what are you ', ' i ', 'what am i ', 'roared the president  and he rose slowly to an incredible height  like some enormous wave about to arch above them and break .', ' you want to know what i am  do you ', 'bull  you are a man of science .', 'grub in the roots of those trees and find out the truth about them .', 'syme  you are a poet .', 'stare at those morning clouds .', 'but i tell you this  that you will have found out the truth of the last tree and the top  most cloud before the truth about me .', 'you will understand the sea  and i shall be still a riddle  you shall know what the stars are  and not know what i am .', 'since the beginning of the world all men have hunted me like a wolf  kings and sages  and poets and lawgivers  all the churches  and all the philosophies .', 'but i have never been caught yet  and the skies will fall in the time i turn to bay .', 'i have given them a good run for their money  and i will now .', 'before one of them could move  the monstrous man had swung himself like some huge ourang  outang over the balustrade of the balcony .', 'yet before he dropped he pulled himself up again as on a horizontal bar  and thrusting his great chin over the edge of the balcony  said solemnly ', ' there  s one thing i  ll tell you though about who i am .', 'i am the man in the dark room  who made you all policemen .', 'with that he fell from the balcony  bouncing on the stones below like a great ball of india  rubber  and went bounding off towards the corner of the alhambra  where he hailed a hansom  cab and sprang inside it .', 'the six detectives had been standing thunderstruck and livid in the light of his last assertion  but when he disappeared into the cab  syme  s practical senses returned to him  and leaping over the balcony so recklessly as almost to break his legs  he called another cab .', 'he and bull sprang into the cab together  the professor and the inspector into another  while the secretary and the late gogol scrambled into a third just in time to pursue the flying syme  who was pursuing the flying president .', 'sunday led them a wild chase towards the north  west  his cabman  evidently under the influence of more than common inducements  urging the horse at breakneck speed .', 'but syme was in no mood for delicacies  and he stood up in his own cab shouting   stop thief ', 'until crowds ran along beside his cab  and policemen began to stop and ask questions .', 'all this had its influence upon the president  s cabman  who began to look dubious  and to slow down to a trot .', 'he opened the trap to talk reasonably to his fare  and in so doing let the long whip droop over the front of the cab .', 'sunday leant forward  seized it  and jerked it violently out of the man  s hand .', 'then standing up in front of the cab himself  he lashed the horse and roared aloud  so that they went down the streets like a flying storm .', 'through street after street and square after square went whirling this preposterous vehicle  in which the fare was urging the horse and the driver trying desperately to stop it .', 'the other three cabs came after it  if the phrase be permissible of a cab  like panting hounds .', 'shops and streets shot by like rattling arrows .', 'at the highest ecstacy of speed  sunday turned round on the splashboard where he stood  and sticking his great grinning head out of the cab  with white hair whistling in the wind  he made a horrible face at his pursuers  like some colossal urchin .', 'then raising his right hand swiftly  he flung a ball of paper in syme  s face and vanished .', 'syme caught the thing while instinctively warding it off  and discovered that it consisted of two crumpled papers .', 'one was addressed to himself  and the other to dr . bull  with a very long  and it is to be feared partly ironical  string of letters after his name .', 'dr . bull  s address was  at any rate  considerably longer than his communication  for the communication consisted entirely of the words ', ' what about martin tupper now ', ' what does the old maniac mean ', 'asked bull  staring at the words .', ' what does yours say  syme ', 'syme  s message was  at any rate  longer  and ran as follows ', ' no one would regret anything in the nature of an interference by the archdeacon more than i . i trust it will not come to that .', 'but  for the last time  where are your goloshes ', 'the thing is too bad  especially after what uncle said .', 'the president  s cabman seemed to be regaining some control over his horse  and the pursuers gained a little as they swept round into the edgware road .', 'and here there occurred what seemed to the allies a providential stoppage .', 'traffic of every kind was swerving to right or left or stopping  for down the long road was coming the unmistakable roar announcing the fire  engine  which in a few seconds went by like a brazen thunderbolt .', 'but quick as it went by  sunday had bounded out of his cab  sprung at the fire  engine  caught it  slung himself on to it  and was seen as he disappeared in the noisy distance talking to the astonished fireman with explanatory gestures .', ' after him ', 'howled syme .', ' he can  t go astray now .', 'there  s no mistaking a fire  engine .', 'the three cabmen  who had been stunned for a moment  whipped up their horses and slightly decreased the distance between themselves and their disappearing prey .', 'the president acknowledged this proximity by coming to the back of the car  bowing repeatedly  kissing his hand  and finally flinging a neatly  folded note into the bosom of inspector ratcliffe .', 'when that gentleman opened it  not without impatience  he found it contained the words ', ' fly at once .', 'the truth about your trouser  stretchers is known .', ' a friend .', 'the fire  engine had struck still farther to the north  into a region that they did not recognise  and as it ran by a line of high railings shadowed with trees  the six friends were startled  but somewhat relieved  to see the president leap from the fire  engine  though whether through another whim or the increasing protest of his entertainers they could not see .', 'before the three cabs  however  could reach up to the spot  he had gone up the high railings like a huge grey cat  tossed himself over  and vanished in a darkness of leaves .', 'syme with a furious gesture stopped his cab  jumped out  and sprang also to the escalade .', 'when he had one leg over the fence and his friends were following  he turned a face on them which shone quite pale in the shadow .', ' what place can this be ', 'he asked .', ' can it be the old devil  s house ', 'i  ve heard he has a house in north london .', ' all the better  said the secretary grimly  planting a foot in a foothold   we shall find him at home .', ' no  but it isn  t that  said syme  knitting his brows .', ' i hear the most horrible noises  like devils laughing and sneezing and blowing their devilish noses ', ' his dogs barking  of course  said the secretary .', ' why not say his black  beetles barking ', 'said syme furiously   snails barking ', 'geraniums barking ', 'did you ever hear a dog bark like that ', 'he held up his hand  and there came out of the thicket a long growling roar that seemed to get under the skin and freeze the flesh  a low thrilling roar that made a throbbing in the air all about them .', ' the dogs of sunday would be no ordinary dogs  said gogol  and shuddered .', 'syme had jumped down on the other side  but he still stood listening impatiently .', ' well  listen to that  he said   is that a dog  anybody  s dog ', 'there broke upon their ear a hoarse screaming as of things protesting and clamouring in sudden pain  and then  far off like an echo  what sounded like a long nasal trumpet .', ' well  his house ought to be hell ', 'said the secretary   and if it is hell  i  m going in ', 'and he sprang over the tall railings almost with one swing .', 'the others followed .', 'they broke through a tangle of plants and shrubs  and came out on an open path .', 'nothing was in sight  but dr . bull suddenly struck his hands together .', ' why  you asses  he cried   it  s the zoo ', 'as they were looking round wildly for any trace of their wild quarry  a keeper in uniform came running along the path with a man in plain clothes .', ' has it come this way ', 'gasped the keeper .', ' has what ', 'asked syme .', ' the elephant ', 'cried the keeper .', ' an elephant has gone mad and run away ', ' he has run away with an old gentleman  said the other stranger breathlessly   a poor old gentleman with white hair  ', ' what sort of old gentleman ', 'asked syme  with great curiosity .', ' a very large and fat old gentleman in light grey clothes  said the keeper eagerly .', ' well  said syme   if he  s that particular kind of old gentleman  if you  re quite sure that he  s a large and fat old gentleman in grey clothes  you may take my word for it that the elephant has not run away with him .', 'he has run away with the elephant .', 'the elephant is not made by god that could run away with him if he did not consent to the elopement .', 'and  by thunder  there he is ', 'there was no doubt about it this time .', 'clean across the space of grass  about two hundred yards away  with a crowd screaming and scampering vainly at his heels  went a huge grey elephant at an awful stride  with his trunk thrown out as rigid as a ship  s bowsprit  and trumpeting like the trumpet of doom .', 'on the back of the bellowing and plunging animal sat president sunday with all the placidity of a sultan  but goading the animal to a furious speed with some sharp object in his hand .', ' stop him ', 'screamed the populace .', ' he  ll be out of the gate ', ' stop a landslide ', 'said the keeper .', ' he is out of the gate ', 'and even as he spoke  a final crash and roar of terror announced that the great grey elephant had broken out of the gates of the zoological gardens  and was careening down albany street like a new and swift sort of omnibus .', ' great lord ', 'cried bull   i never knew an elephant could go so fast .', 'well  it must be hansom  cabs again if we are to keep him in sight .', 'as they raced along to the gate out of which the elephant had vanished  syme felt a glaring panorama of the strange animals in the cages which they passed .', 'afterwards he thought it queer that he should have seen them so clearly .', 'he remembered especially seeing pelicans  with their preposterous  pendant throats .', 'he wondered why the pelican was the symbol of charity  except it was that it wanted a good deal of charity to admire a pelican .', 'he remembered a hornbill  which was simply a huge yellow beak with a small bird tied on behind it .', 'the whole gave him a sensation  the vividness of which he could not explain  that nature was always making quite mysterious jokes .', 'sunday had told them that they would understand him when they had understood the stars .', 'he wondered whether even the archangels understood the hornbill .', 'the six unhappy detectives flung themselves into cabs and followed the elephant sharing the terror which he spread through the long stretch of the streets .', 'this time sunday did not turn round  but offered them the solid stretch of his unconscious back  which maddened them  if possible  more than his previous mockeries .', 'just before they came to baker street  however  he was seen to throw something far up into the air  as a boy does a ball meaning to catch it again .', 'but at their rate of racing it fell far behind  just by the cab containing gogol  and in faint hope of a clue or for some impulse unexplainable  he stopped his cab so as to pick it up .', 'it was addressed to himself  and was quite a bulky parcel .', 'on examination  however  its bulk was found to consist of thirty  three pieces of paper of no value wrapped one round the other .', 'when the last covering was torn away it reduced itself to a small slip of paper  on which was written ', ' the word  i fancy  should be  pink .', 'the man once known as gogol said nothing  but the movements of his hands and feet were like those of a man urging a horse to renewed efforts .', 'through street after street  through district after district  went the prodigy of the flying elephant  calling crowds to every window  and driving the traffic left and right .', 'and still through all this insane publicity the three cabs toiled after it  until they came to be regarded as part of a procession  and perhaps the advertisement of a circus .', 'they went at such a rate that distances were shortened beyond belief  and syme saw the albert hall in kensington when he thought that he was still in paddington .', 'the animal  s pace was even more fast and free through the empty  aristocratic streets of south kensington  and he finally headed towards that part of the sky  line where the enormous wheel of earl  s court stood up in the sky .', 'the wheel grew larger and larger  till it filled heaven like the wheel of stars .', 'the beast outstripped the cabs .', 'they lost him round several corners  and when they came to one of the gates of the earl  s court exhibition they found themselves finally blocked .', 'in front of them was an enormous crowd  in the midst of it was an enormous elephant  heaving and shuddering as such shapeless creatures do .', 'but the president had disappeared .', ' where has he gone to ', 'asked syme  slipping to the ground .', ' gentleman rushed into the exhibition  sir ', 'said an official in a dazed manner .', 'then he added in an injured voice   funny gentleman  sir .', 'asked me to hold his horse  and gave me this .', 'he held out with distaste a piece of folded paper  addressed   to the secretary of the central anarchist council .', 'the secretary  raging  rent it open  and found written inside it ', ' when the herring runs a mile  let the secretary smile  when the herring tries to fly  let the secretary die .', 'rustic proverb .', ' why the eternal crikey  began the secretary   did you let the man in ', 'do people commonly come to you exhibition riding on mad elephants ', 'do ', ' look ', 'shouted syme suddenly .', ' look over there ', ' look at what ', 'asked the secretary savagely .', ' look at the captive balloon ', 'said syme  and pointed in a frenzy .', ' why the blazes should i look at a captive balloon ', 'demanded the secretary .', ' what is there queer about a captive balloon ', ' nothing  said syme   except that it isn  t captive ', 'they all turned their eyes to where the balloon swung and swelled above the exhibition on a string  like a child  s balloon .', 'a second afterwards the string came in two just under the car  and the balloon  broken loose  floated away with the freedom of a soap bubble .', ' ten thousand devils ', 'shrieked the secretary .', ' he  s got into it ', 'and he shook his fists at the sky .', 'the balloon  borne by some chance wind  came right above them  and they could see the great white head of the president peering over the side and looking benevolently down on them .', ' god bless my soul ', 'said the professor with the elderly manner that he could never disconnect from his bleached beard and parchment face .', ' god bless my soul ', 'i seemed to fancy that something fell on the top of my hat ', 'he put up a trembling hand and took from that shelf a piece of twisted paper  which he opened absently only to find it inscribed with a true lover  s knot and  the words ', ' your beauty has not left me indifferent . from little snowdrop . ', 'there was a short silence  and then syme said  biting his beard ', ' i  m not beaten yet .', 'the blasted thing must come down somewhere .', 'let  s follow it ', 'chapter xiv', 'the six philosophers', 'across green fields  and breaking through blooming hedges  toiled six draggled detectives  about five miles out of london .', 'the optimist of the party had at first proposed that they should follow the balloon across south england in hansom  cabs .', 'but he was ultimately convinced of the persistent refusal of the balloon to follow the roads  and the still more persistent refusal of the cabmen to follow the balloon .', 'consequently the tireless though exasperated travellers broke through black thickets and ploughed through ploughed fields till each was turned into a figure too outrageous to be mistaken for a tramp .', 'those green hills of surrey saw the final collapse and tragedy of the admirable light grey suit in which syme had set out from saffron park .', 'his silk hat was broken over his nose by a swinging bough  his coat  tails were torn to the shoulder by arresting thorns  the clay of england was splashed up to his collar  but he still carried his yellow beard forward with a silent and furious determination  and his eyes were still fixed on that floating ball of gas  which in the full flush of sunset seemed coloured like a sunset cloud .', ' after all  he said   it is very beautiful ', ' it is singularly and strangely beautiful ', 'said the professor .', ' i wish the beastly gas  bag would burst ', ' no  said dr . bull   i hope it won  t .', 'it might hurt the old boy .', ' hurt him ', 'said the vindictive professor   hurt him ', 'not as much as i  d hurt him if i could get up with him .', 'little snowdrop ', ' i don  t want him hurt  somehow  said dr . bull .', ' what ', 'cried the secretary bitterly .', ' do you believe all that tale about his being our man in the dark room ', 'sunday would say he was anybody .', ' i don  t know whether i believe it or not  said dr . bull .', ' but it isn  t that that i mean .', 'i can  t wish old sunday  s balloon to burst because ', ' well  said syme impatiently   because ', ' well  because he  s so jolly like a balloon himself  said dr . bull desperately .', ' i don  t understand a word of all that idea of his being the same man who gave us all our blue cards .', 'it seems to make everything nonsense .', 'but i don  t care who knows it  i always had a sympathy for old sunday himself  wicked as he was .', 'just as if he was a great bouncing baby .', 'how can i explain what my queer sympathy was ', 'it didn  t prevent my fighting him like hell ', 'shall i make it clear if i say that i liked him because he was so fat ', ' you will not  said the secretary .', ' i  ve got it now  cried bull   it was because he was so fat and so light .', 'just like a balloon .', 'we always think of fat people as heavy  but he could have danced against a sylph .', 'i see now what i mean .', 'moderate strength is shown in violence  supreme strength is shown in levity .', 'it was like the old speculations  what would happen if an elephant could leap up in the sky like a grasshopper ', ' our elephant  said syme  looking upwards   has leapt into the sky like a grasshopper .', ' and somehow  concluded bull   that  s why i can  t help liking old sunday .', 'no  it  s not an admiration of force  or any silly thing like that .', 'there is a kind of gaiety in the thing  as if he were bursting with some good news .', 'haven  t you sometimes felt it on a spring day ', 'you know nature plays tricks  but somehow that day proves they are good  natured tricks .', 'i never read the bible myself  but that part they laugh at is literal truth   why leap ye  ye high hills ', 'the hills do leap  at least  they try to .', '.', '.', '.', 'why do i like sunday ', '.', '.', '.', 'how can i tell you ', '.', '.', '.', 'because he  s such a bounder .', 'there was a long silence  and then the secretary said in a curious  strained voice ', ' you do not know sunday at all .', 'perhaps it is because you are better than i  and do not know hell .', 'i was a fierce fellow  and a trifle morbid from the first .', 'the man who sits in darkness  and who chose us all  chose me because i had all the crazy look of a conspirator  because my smile went crooked  and my eyes were gloomy  even when i smiled .', 'but there must have been something in me that answered to the nerves in all these anarchic men .', 'for when i first saw sunday he expressed to me  not your airy vitality  but something both gross and sad in the nature of things .', 'i found him smoking in a twilight room  a room with brown blind down  infinitely more depressing than the genial darkness in which our master lives .', 'he sat there on a bench  a huge heap of a man  dark and out of shape .', 'he listened to all my words without speaking or even stirring .', 'i poured out my most passionate appeals  and asked my most eloquent questions .', 'then  after a long silence  the thing began to shake  and i thought it was shaken by some secret malady .', 'it shook like a loathsome and living jelly .', 'it reminded me of everything i had ever read about the base bodies that are the origin of life  the deep sea lumps and protoplasm .', 'it seemed like the final form of matter  the most shapeless and the most shameful .', 'i could only tell myself  from its shudderings  that it was something at least that such a monster could be miserable .', 'and then it broke upon me that the bestial mountain was shaking with a lonely laughter  and the laughter was at me .', 'do you ask me to forgive him that ', 'it is no small thing to be laughed at by something at once lower and stronger than oneself .', ' surely you fellows are exaggerating wildly  cut in the clear voice of inspector ratcliffe .', ' president sunday is a terrible fellow for one  s intellect  but he is not such a barnum  s freak physically as you make out .', 'he received me in an ordinary office  in a grey check coat  in broad daylight .', 'he talked to me in an ordinary way .', 'but i  ll tell you what is a trifle creepy about sunday .', 'his room is neat  his clothes are neat  everything seems in order  but he  s absent  minded .', 'sometimes his great bright eyes go quite blind .', 'for hours he forgets that you are there .', 'now absent  mindedness is just a bit too awful in a bad man .', 'we think of a wicked man as vigilant .', 'we can  t think of a wicked man who is honestly and sincerely dreamy  because we daren  t think of a wicked man alone with himself .', 'an absentminded man means a good  natured man .', 'it means a man who  if he happens to see you  will apologise .', 'but how will you bear an absentminded man who  if he happens to see you  will kill you ', 'that is what tries the nerves  abstraction combined with cruelty .', 'men have felt it sometimes when they went through wild forests  and felt that the animals there were at once innocent and pitiless .', 'they might ignore or slay .', 'how would you like to pass ten mortal hours in a parlour with an absent  minded tiger ', ' and what do you think of sunday  gogol ', 'asked syme .', ' i don  t think of sunday on principle  said gogol simply   any more than i stare at the sun at noonday .', ' well  that is a point of view  said syme thoughtfully .', ' what do you say  professor ', 'the professor was walking with bent head and trailing stick  and he did not answer at all .', ' wake up  professor ', 'said syme genially .', ' tell us what you think of sunday .', 'the professor spoke at last very slowly .', ' i think something  he said   that i cannot say clearly .', 'or  rather  i think something that i cannot even think clearly .', 'but it is something like this .', 'my early life  as you know  was a bit too large and loose .', 'well  when i saw sunday  s face i thought it was too large  everybody does  but i also thought it was too loose .', 'the face was so big  that one couldn  t focus it or make it a face at all .', 'the eye was so far away from the nose  that it wasn  t an eye .', 'the mouth was so much by itself  that one had to think of it by itself .', 'the whole thing is too hard to explain .', 'he paused for a little  still trailing his stick  and then went on ', ' but put it this way .', 'walking up a road at night  i have seen a lamp and a lighted window and a cloud make together a most complete and unmistakable face .', 'if anyone in heaven has that face i shall know him again .', 'yet when i walked a little farther i found that there was no face  that the window was ten yards away  the lamp ten hundred yards  the cloud beyond the world .', 'well  sunday  s face escaped me  it ran away to right and left  as such chance pictures run away .', 'and so his face has made me  somehow  doubt whether there are any faces .', 'i don  t know whether your face  bull  is a face or a combination in perspective .', 'perhaps one black disc of your beastly glasses is quite close and another fifty miles away .', 'oh  the doubts of a materialist are not worth a dump .', 'sunday has taught me the last and the worst doubts  the doubts of a spiritualist .', 'i am a buddhist  i suppose  and buddhism is not a creed  it is a doubt .', 'my poor dear bull  i do not believe that you really have a face .', 'i have not faith enough to believe in matter .', 'syme  s eyes were still fixed upon the errant orb  which  reddened in the evening light  looked like some rosier and more innocent world .', ' have you noticed an odd thing  he said   about all your descriptions ', 'each man of you finds sunday quite different  yet each man of you can only find one thing to compare him to  the universe itself .', 'bull finds him like the earth in spring  gogol like the sun at noonday .', 'the secretary is reminded of the shapeless protoplasm  and the inspector of the carelessness of virgin forests .', 'the professor says he is like a changing landscape .', 'this is queer  but it is queerer still that i also have had my odd notion about the president  and i also find that i think of sunday as i think of the whole world .', ' get on a little faster  syme  said bull   never mind the balloon .', ' when i first saw sunday  said syme slowly   i only saw his back  and when i saw his back  i knew he was the worst man in the world .', 'his neck and shoulders were brutal  like those of some apish god .', 'his head had a stoop that was hardly human  like the stoop of an ox .', 'in fact  i had at once the revolting fancy that this was not a man at all  but a beast dressed up in men  s clothes .', ' get on  said dr . bull .', ' and then the queer thing happened .', 'i had seen his back from the street  as he sat in the balcony .', 'then i entered the hotel  and coming round the other side of him  saw his face in the sunlight .', 'his face frightened me  as it did everyone  but not because it was brutal  not because it was evil .', 'on the contrary  it frightened me because it was so beautiful  because it was so good .', ' syme  exclaimed the secretary   are you ill ', ' it was like the face of some ancient archangel  judging justly after heroic wars .', 'there was laughter in the eyes  and in the mouth honour and sorrow .', 'there was the same white hair  the same great  grey  clad shoulders that i had seen from behind .', 'but when i saw him from behind i was certain he was an animal  and when i saw him in front i knew he was a god .', ' pan  said the professor dreamily   was a god and an animal .', ' then  and again and always  went on syme like a man talking to himself   that has been for me the mystery of sunday  and it is also the mystery of the world .', 'when i see the horrible back  i am sure the noble face is but a mask .', 'when i see the face but for an instant  i know the back is only a jest .', 'bad is so bad  that we cannot but think good an accident  good is so good  that we feel certain that evil could be explained .', 'but the whole came to a kind of crest yesterday when i raced sunday for the cab  and was just behind him all the way .', ' had you time for thinking then ', 'asked ratcliffe .', ' time  replied syme   for one outrageous thought .', 'i was suddenly possessed with the idea that the blind  blank back of his head really was his face  an awful  eyeless face staring at me ', 'and i fancied that the figure running in front of me was really a figure running backwards  and dancing as he ran .', ' horrible ', 'said dr . bull  and shuddered .', ' horrible is not the word  said syme .', ' it was exactly the worst instant of my life .', 'and yet ten minutes afterwards  when he put his head out of the cab and made a grimace like a gargoyle  i knew that he was only like a father playing hide  and  seek with his children .', ' it is a long game  said the secretary  and frowned at his broken boots .', ' listen to me  cried syme with extraordinary emphasis .', ' shall i tell you the secret of the whole world ', 'it is that we have only known the back of the world .', 'we see everything from behind  and it looks brutal .', 'that is not a tree  but the back of a tree .', 'that is not a cloud  but the back of a cloud .', 'cannot you see that everything is stooping and hiding a face ', 'if we could only get round in front ', ' look ', 'cried out bull clamorously   the balloon is coming down ', 'there was no need to cry out to syme  who had never taken his eyes off it .', 'he saw the great luminous globe suddenly stagger in the sky  right itself  and then sink slowly behind the trees like a setting sun .', 'the man called gogol  who had hardly spoken through all their weary travels  suddenly threw up his hands like a lost spirit .', ' he is dead ', 'he cried .', ' and now i know he was my friend  my friend in the dark ', ' dead ', 'snorted the secretary .', ' you will not find him dead easily .', 'if he has been tipped out of the car  we shall find him rolling as a colt rolls in a field  kicking his legs for fun .', ' clashing his hoofs  said the professor .', ' the colts do  and so did pan .', ' pan again ', 'said dr . bull irritably .', ' you seem to think pan is everything .', ' so he is  said the professor   in greek .', 'he means everything .', ' don  t forget  said the secretary  looking down   that he also means panic .', 'syme had stood without hearing any of the exclamations .', ' it fell over there  he said shortly .', ' let us follow it ', 'then he added with an indescribable gesture ', ' oh  if he has cheated us all by getting killed ', 'it would be like one of his larks .', 'he strode off towards the distant trees with a new energy  his rags and ribbons fluttering in the wind .', 'the others followed him in a more footsore and dubious manner .', 'and almost at the same moment all six men realised that they were not alone in the little field .', 'across the square of turf a tall man was advancing towards them  leaning on a strange long staff like a sceptre .', 'he was clad in a fine but old  fashioned suit with knee  breeches  its colour was that shade between blue  violet and grey which can be seen in certain shadows of the woodland .', 'his hair was whitish grey  and at the first glance  taken along with his knee  breeches  looked as if it was powdered .', 'his advance was very quiet  but for the silver frost upon his head  he might have been one to the shadows of the wood .', ' gentlemen  he said   my master has a carriage waiting for you in the road just by .', ' who is your master ', 'asked syme  standing quite still .', ' i was told you knew his name  said the man respectfully .', 'there was a silence  and then the secretary said ', ' where is this carriage ', ' it has been waiting only a few moments  said the stranger .', ' my master has only just come home .', 'syme looked left and right upon the patch of green field in which he found himself .', 'the hedges were ordinary hedges  the trees seemed ordinary trees  yet he felt like a man entrapped in fairyland .', 'he looked the mysterious ambassador up and down  but he could discover nothing except that the man  s coat was the exact colour of the purple shadows  and that the man  s face was the exact colour of the red and brown and golden sky .', ' show us the place  syme said briefly  and without a word the man in the violet coat turned his back and walked towards a gap in the hedge  which let in suddenly the light of a white road .', 'as the six wanderers broke out upon this thoroughfare  they saw the white road blocked by what looked like a long row of carriages  such a row of carriages as might close the approach to some house in park lane .', 'along the side of these carriages stood a rank of splendid servants  all dressed in the grey  blue uniform  and all having a certain quality of stateliness and freedom which would not commonly belong to the servants of a gentleman  but rather to the officials and ambassadors of a great king .', 'there were no less than six carriages waiting  one for each of the tattered and miserable band .', 'all the attendants  as if in court  dress  wore swords  and as each man crawled into his carriage they drew them  and saluted with a sudden blaze of steel .', ' what can it all mean ', 'asked bull of syme as they separated .', ' is this another joke of sunday  s ', ' i don  t know  said syme as he sank wearily back in the cushions of his carriage   but if it is  it  s one of the jokes you talk about .', 'it  s a good  natured one .', 'the six adventurers had passed through many adventures  but not one had carried them so utterly off their feet as this last adventure of comfort .', 'they had all become inured to things going roughly  but things suddenly going smoothly swamped them .', 'they could not even feebly imagine what the carriages were  it was enough for them to know that they were carriages  and carriages with cushions .', 'they could not conceive who the old man was who had led them  but it was quite enough that he had certainly led them to the carriages .', 'syme drove through a drifting darkness of trees in utter abandonment .', 'it was typical of him that while he had carried his bearded chin forward fiercely so long as anything could be done  when the whole business was taken out of his hands he fell back on the cushions in a frank collapse .', 'very gradually and very vaguely he realised into what rich roads the carriage was carrying him .', 'he saw that they passed the stone gates of what might have been a park  that they began gradually to climb a hill which  while wooded on both sides  was somewhat more orderly than a forest .', 'then there began to grow upon him  as upon a man slowly waking from a healthy sleep  a pleasure in everything .', 'he felt that the hedges were what hedges should be  living walls  that a hedge is like a human army  disciplined  but all the more alive .', 'he saw high elms behind the hedges  and vaguely thought how happy boys would be climbing there .', 'then his carriage took a turn of the path  and he saw suddenly and quietly  like a long  low  sunset cloud  a long  low house  mellow in the mild light of sunset .', 'all the six friends compared notes afterwards and quarrelled  but they all agreed that in some unaccountable way the place reminded them of their boyhood .', 'it was either this elm  top or that crooked path  it was either this scrap of orchard or that shape of a window  but each man of them declared that he could remember this place before he could remember his mother .', 'when the carriages eventually rolled up to a large  low  cavernous gateway  another man in the same uniform  but wearing a silver star on the grey breast of his coat  came out to meet them .', 'this impressive person said to the bewildered syme ', ' refreshments are provided for you in your room .', 'syme  under the influence of the same mesmeric sleep of amazement  went up the large oaken stairs after the respectful attendant .', 'he entered a splendid suite of apartments that seemed to be designed specially for him .', 'he walked up to a long mirror with the ordinary instinct of his class  to pull his tie straight or to smooth his hair  and there he saw the frightful figure that he was  blood running down his face from where the bough had struck him  his hair standing out like yellow rags of rank grass  his clothes torn into long  wavering tatters .', 'at once the whole enigma sprang up  simply as the question of how he had got there  and how he was to get out again .', 'exactly at the same moment a man in blue  who had been appointed as his valet  said very solemnly ', ' i have put out your clothes  sir .', ' clothes ', 'said syme sardonically .', ' i have no clothes except these  and he lifted two long strips of his frock  coat in fascinating festoons  and made a movement as if to twirl like a ballet girl .', ' my master asks me to say  said the attendant  that there is a fancy dress ball tonight  and that he desires you to put on the costume that i have laid out .', 'meanwhile  sir  there is a bottle of burgundy and some cold pheasant  which he hopes you will not refuse  as it is some hours before supper .', ' cold pheasant is a good thing  said syme reflectively   and burgundy is a spanking good thing .', 'but really i do not want either of them so much as i want to know what the devil all this means  and what sort of costume you have got laid out for me .', 'where is it ', 'the servant lifted off a kind of ottoman a long peacock  blue drapery  rather of the nature of a domino  on the front of which was emblazoned a large golden sun  and which was splashed here and there with flaming stars and crescents .', ' you  re to be dressed as thursday  sir  said the valet somewhat affably .', ' dressed as thursday ', 'said syme in meditation .', ' it doesn  t sound a warm costume .', ' oh  yes  sir  said the other eagerly   the thursday costume is quite warm  sir .', 'it fastens up to the chin .', ' well  i don  t understand anything  said syme  sighing .', ' i have been used so long to uncomfortable adventures that comfortable adventures knock me out .', 'still  i may be allowed to ask why i should be particularly like thursday in a green frock spotted all over with the sun and moon .', 'those orbs  i think  shine on other days .', 'i once saw the moon on tuesday  i remember .', ' beg pardon  sir  said the valet   bible also provided for you  and with a respectful and rigid finger he pointed out a passage in the first chapter of genesis .', 'syme read it wondering .', 'it was that in which the fourth day of the week is associated with the creation of the sun and moon .', 'here  however  they reckoned from a christian sunday .', ' this is getting wilder and wilder  said syme  as he sat down in a chair .', ' who are these people who provide cold pheasant and burgundy  and green clothes and bibles ', 'do they provide everything ', ' yes  sir  everything  said the attendant gravely .', ' shall i help you on with your costume ', ' oh  hitch the bally thing on ', 'said syme impatiently .', 'but though he affected to despise the mummery  he felt a curious freedom and naturalness in his movements as the blue and gold garment fell about him  and when he found that he had to wear a sword  it stirred a boyish dream .', 'as he passed out of the room he flung the folds across his shoulder with a gesture  his sword stood out at an angle  and he had all the swagger of a troubadour .', 'for these disguises did not disguise  but reveal .', 'chapter xv', 'the accuser', 'as syme strode along the corridor he saw the secretary standing at the top of a great flight of stairs .', 'the man had never looked so noble .', 'he was draped in a long robe of starless black  down the centre of which fell a band or broad stripe of pure white  like a single shaft of light .', 'the whole looked like some very severe ecclesiastical vestment .', 'there was no need for syme to search his memory or the bible in order to remember that the first day of creation marked the mere creation of light out of darkness .', 'the vestment itself would alone have suggested the symbol  and syme felt also how perfectly this pattern of pure white and black expressed the soul of the pale and austere secretary  with his inhuman veracity and his cold frenzy  which made him so easily make war on the anarchists  and yet so easily pass for one of them .', 'syme was scarcely surprised to notice that  amid all the ease and hospitality of their new surroundings  this man  s eyes were still stern .', 'no smell of ale or orchards could make the secretary cease to ask a reasonable question .', 'if syme had been able to see himself  he would have realised that he  too  seemed to be for the first time himself and no one else .', 'for if the secretary stood for that philosopher who loves the original and formless light  syme was a type of the poet who seeks always to make the light in special shapes  to split it up into sun and star .', 'the philosopher may sometimes love the infinite  the poet always loves the finite .', 'for him the great moment is not the creation of light  but the creation of the sun and moon .', 'as they descended the broad stairs together they overtook ratcliffe  who was clad in spring green like a huntsman  and the pattern upon whose garment was a green tangle of trees .', 'for he stood for that third day on which the earth and green things were made  and his square  sensible face  with its not unfriendly cynicism  seemed appropriate enough to it .', 'they were led out of another broad and low gateway into a very large old english garden  full of torches and bonfires  by the broken light of which a vast carnival of people were dancing in motley dress .', 'syme seemed to see every shape in nature imitated in some crazy costume .', 'there was a man dressed as a windmill with enormous sails  a man dressed as an elephant  a man dressed as a balloon  the two last  together  seemed to keep the thread of their farcical adventures .', 'syme even saw  with a queer thrill  one dancer dressed like an enormous hornbill  with a beak twice as big as himself  the queer bird which had fixed itself on his fancy like a living question while he was rushing down the long road at the zoological gardens .', 'there were a thousand other such objects  however .', 'there was a dancing lamp  post  a dancing apple tree  a dancing ship .', 'one would have thought that the untamable tune of some mad musician had set all the common objects of field and street dancing an eternal jig .', 'and long afterwards  when syme was middle  aged and at rest  he could never see one of those particular objects  a lamppost  or an apple tree  or a windmill  without thinking that it was a strayed reveller from that revel of masquerade .', 'on one side of this lawn  alive with dancers  was a sort of green bank  like the terrace in such old  fashioned gardens .', 'along this  in a kind of crescent  stood seven great chairs  the thrones of the seven days .', 'gogol and dr . bull were already in their seats  the professor was just mounting to his .', 'gogol  or tuesday  had his simplicity well symbolised by a dress designed upon the division of the waters  a dress that separated upon his forehead and fell to his feet  grey and silver  like a sheet of rain .', 'the professor  whose day was that on which the birds and fishes  the ruder forms of life  were created  had a dress of dim purple  over which sprawled goggle  eyed fishes and outrageous tropical birds  the union in him of unfathomable fancy and of doubt .', 'dr . bull  the last day of creation  wore a coat covered with heraldic animals in red and gold  and on his crest a man rampant .', 'he lay back in his chair with a broad smile  the picture of an optimist in his element .', 'one by one the wanderers ascended the bank and sat in their strange seats .', 'as each of them sat down a roar of enthusiasm rose from the carnival  such as that with which crowds receive kings .', 'cups were clashed and torches shaken  and feathered hats flung in the air .', 'the men for whom these thrones were reserved were men crowned with some extraordinary laurels .', 'but the central chair was empty .', 'syme was on the left hand of it and the secretary on the right .', 'the secretary looked across the empty throne at syme  and said  compressing his lips ', ' we do not know yet that he is not dead in a field .', 'almost as syme heard the words  he saw on the sea of human faces in front of him a frightful and beautiful alteration  as if heaven had opened behind his head .', 'but sunday had only passed silently along the front like a shadow  and had sat in the central seat .', 'he was draped plainly  in a pure and terrible white  and his hair was like a silver flame on his forehead .', 'for a long time  it seemed for hours  that huge masquerade of mankind swayed and stamped in front of them to marching and exultant music .', 'every couple dancing seemed a separate romance  it might be a fairy dancing with a pillar  box  or a peasant girl dancing with the moon  but in each case it was  somehow  as absurd as alice in wonderland  yet as grave and kind as a love story .', 'at last  however  the thick crowd began to thin itself .', 'couples strolled away into the garden  walks  or began to drift towards that end of the building where stood smoking  in huge pots like fish  kettles  some hot and scented mixtures of old ale or wine .', 'above all these  upon a sort of black framework on the roof of the house  roared in its iron basket a gigantic bonfire  which lit up the land for miles .', 'it flung the homely effect of firelight over the face of vast forests of grey or brown  and it seemed to fill with warmth even the emptiness of upper night .', 'yet this also  after a time  was allowed to grow fainter  the dim groups gathered more and more round the great cauldrons  or passed  laughing and clattering  into the inner passages of that ancient house .', 'soon there were only some ten loiterers in the garden  soon only four .', 'finally the last stray merry  maker ran into the house whooping to his companions .', 'the fire faded  and the slow  strong stars came out .', 'and the seven strange men were left alone  like seven stone statues on their chairs of stone .', 'not one of them had spoken a word .', 'they seemed in no haste to do so  but heard in silence the hum of insects and the distant song of one bird .', 'then sunday spoke  but so dreamily that he might have been continuing a conversation rather than beginning one .', ' we will eat and drink later  he said .', ' let us remain together a little  we who have loved each other so sadly  and have fought so long .', 'i seem to remember only centuries of heroic war  in which you were always heroes  epic on epic  iliad on iliad  and you always brothers in arms .', 'whether it was but recently  for time is nothing  or at the beginning of the world  i sent you out to war .', 'i sat in the darkness  where there is not any created thing  and to you i was only a voice commanding valour and an unnatural virtue .', 'you heard the voice in the dark  and you never heard it again .', 'the sun in heaven denied it  the earth and sky denied it  all human wisdom denied it .', 'and when i met you in the daylight i denied it myself .', 'syme stirred sharply in his seat  but otherwise there was silence  and the incomprehensible went on .', ' but you were men .', 'you did not forget your secret honour  though the whole cosmos turned an engine of torture to tear it out of you .', 'i knew how near you were to hell .', 'i know how you  thursday  crossed swords with king satan  and how you  wednesday  named me in the hour without hope .', 'there was complete silence in the starlit garden  and then the black  browed secretary  implacable  turned in his chair towards sunday  and said in a harsh voice ', ' who and what are you ', ' i am the sabbath  said the other without moving .', ' i am the peace of god .', 'the secretary started up  and stood crushing his costly robe in his hand .', ' i know what you mean  he cried   and it is exactly that that i cannot forgive you .', 'i know you are contentment  optimism  what do they call the thing  an ultimate reconciliation .', 'well  i am not reconciled .', 'if you were the man in the dark room  why were you also sunday  an offense to the sunlight ', 'if you were from the first our father and our friend  why were you also our greatest enemy ', 'we wept  we fled in terror  the iron entered into our souls  and you are the peace of god ', 'oh  i can forgive god his anger  though it destroyed nations  but i cannot forgive him his peace .', 'sunday answered not a word  but very slowly he turned his face of stone upon syme as if asking a question .', ' no  said syme   i do not feel fierce like that .', 'i am grateful to you  not only for wine and hospitality here  but for many a fine scamper and free fight .', 'but i should like to know .', 'my soul and heart are as happy and quiet here as this old garden  but my reason is still crying out .', 'i should like to know .', 'sunday looked at ratcliffe  whose clear voice said ', ' it seems so silly that you should have been on both sides and fought yourself .', 'bull said ', ' l understand nothing  but i am happy .', 'in fact  i am going to sleep .', ' i am not happy  said the professor with his head in his hands   because i do not understand .', 'you let me stray a little too near to hell .', 'and then gogol said  with the absolute simplicity of a child ', ' i wish i knew why i was hurt so much .', 'still sunday said nothing  but only sat with his mighty chin upon his hand  and gazed at the distance .', 'then at last he said ', ' i have heard your complaints in order .', 'and here  i think  comes another to complain  and we will hear him also .', 'the falling fire in the great cresset threw a last long gleam  like a bar of burning gold  across the dim grass .', 'against this fiery band was outlined in utter black the advancing legs of a black  clad figure .', 'he seemed to have a fine close suit with knee  breeches such as that which was worn by the servants of the house  only that it was not blue  but of this absolute sable .', 'he had  like the servants  a kind of word by his side .', 'it was only when he had come quite close to the crescent of the seven and flung up his face to look at them  that syme saw  with thunder  struck clearness  that the face was the broad  almost ape  like face of his old friend gregory  with its rank red hair and its insulting smile .', ' gregory ', 'gasped syme  half  rising from his seat .', ' why  this is the real anarchist ', ' yes  said gregory  with a great and dangerous restraint   i am the real anarchist .', ' now there was a day  murmured bull  who seemed really to have fallen asleep   when the sons of god came to present themselves before the lord  and satan came also among them .', ' you are right  said gregory  and gazed all round .', ' i am a destroyer .', 'i would destroy the world if i could .', 'a sense of a pathos far under the earth stirred up in syme  and he spoke brokenly and without sequence .', ' oh  most unhappy man  he cried   try to be happy ', 'you have red hair like your sister .', ' my red hair  like red flames  shall burn up the world  said gregory .', ' i thought i hated everything more than common men can hate anything  but i find that i do not hate everything so much as i hate you  ', ' i never hated you  said syme very sadly .', 'then out of this unintelligible creature the last thunders broke .', ' you ', 'he cried .', ' you never hated because you never lived .', 'i know what you are all of you  from first to last  you are the people in power ', 'you are the police  the great fat  smiling men in blue and buttons ', 'you are the law  and you have never been broken .', 'but is there a free soul alive that does not long to break you  only because you have never been broken ', 'we in revolt talk all kind of nonsense doubtless about this crime or that crime of the government .', 'it is all folly ', 'the only crime of the government is that it governs .', 'the unpardonable sin of the supreme power is that it is supreme .', 'i do not curse you for being cruel .', 'i do not curse you  though i might  for being kind .', 'i curse you for being safe ', 'you sit in your chairs of stone  and have never come down from them .', 'you are the seven angels of heaven  and you have had no troubles .', 'oh  i could forgive you everything  you that rule all mankind  if i could feel for once that you had suffered for one hour a real agony such as i ', 'syme sprang to his feet  shaking from head to foot .', ' i see everything  he cried   everything that there is .', 'why does each thing on the earth war against each other thing ', 'why does each small thing in the world have to fight against the world itself ', 'why does a fly have to fight the whole universe ', 'why does a dandelion have to fight the whole universe ', 'for the same reason that i had to be alone in the dreadful council of the days .', 'so that each thing that obeys law may have the glory and isolation of the anarchist .', 'so that each man fighting for order may be as brave and good a man as the dynamiter .', 'so that the real lie of satan may be flung back in the face of this blasphemer  so that by tears and torture we may earn the right to say to this man   you lie ', 'no agonies can be too great to buy the right to say to this accuser   we also have suffered .', ' it is not true that we have never been broken .', 'we have been broken upon the wheel .', 'it is not true that we have never descended from these thrones .', 'we have descended into hell .', 'we were complaining of unforgettable miseries even at the very moment when this man entered insolently to accuse us of happiness .', 'i repel the slander  we have not been happy .', 'i can answer for every one of the great guards of law whom he has accused .', 'at least ', 'he had turned his eyes so as to see suddenly the great face of sunday  which wore a strange smile .', ' have you  he cried in a dreadful voice   have you ever suffered ', 'as he gazed  the great face grew to an awful size  grew larger than the colossal mask of memnon  which had made him scream as a child .', 'it grew larger and larger  filling the whole sky  then everything went black .', 'only in the blackness before it entirely destroyed his brain he seemed to hear a distant voice saying a commonplace text that he had heard somewhere   can ye drink of the cup that i drink of ', '  ', 'when men in books awake from a vision  they commonly find themselves in some place in which they might have fallen asleep  they yawn in a chair  or lift themselves with bruised limbs from a field .', 'syme  s experience was something much more psychologically strange if there was indeed anything unreal  in the earthly sense  about the things he had gone through .', 'for while he could always remember afterwards that he had swooned before the face of sunday  he could not remember having ever come to at all .', 'he could only remember that gradually and naturally he knew that he was and had been walking along a country lane with an easy and conversational companion .', 'that companion had been a part of his recent drama  it was the red  haired poet gregory .', 'they were walking like old friends  and were in the middle of a conversation about some triviality .', 'but syme could only feel an unnatural buoyancy in his body and a crystal simplicity in his mind that seemed to be superior to everything that he said or did .', 'he felt he was in possession of some impossible good news  which made every other thing a triviality  but an adorable triviality .', 'dawn was breaking over everything in colours at once clear and timid  as if nature made a first attempt at yellow and a first attempt at rose .', 'a breeze blew so clean and sweet  that one could not think that it blew from the sky  it blew rather through some hole in the sky .', 'syme felt a simple surprise when he saw rising all round him on both sides of the road the red  irregular buildings of saffron park .', 'he had no idea that he had walked so near london .', 'he walked by instinct along one white road  on which early birds hopped and sang  and found himself outside a fenced garden .', 'there he saw the sister of gregory  the girl with the gold  red hair  cutting lilac before breakfast  with the great unconscious gravity of a girl .', ' paradise lost by john milton  ', 'book i', 'of man  s first disobedience  and the fruit of that forbidden tree whose mortal taste brought death into the world  and

thus adam sore beset replied .', 'o heaven ', 'in evil strait this day i stand before my judge  either to undergo myself the total crime  or to accuse my other self  the partner of my life  whose failing  while her faith to me remains  i should conceal  and not expose to blame by my complaint  but strict necessity subdues me  and calamitous constraint  lest on my head both sin and punishment

manhood  and the place wherein god set thee above her made of thee  and for thee  whose perfection far excelled hers in all real dignity ', 'adorned she was indeed  and lovely  to attract thy love  not thy subjection  and her gifts were such  as under government well seemed  unseemly to bear rule  which was thy part and person  hadst thou known thyself aright .', 'so having said  he thus to eve in few .', 'say  woman  what is this which thou hast done ', 'to whom sad eve  with shame nigh overwhelmed  confessing soon  yet not before her judge bold or loquacious  thus abashed replied .', 'the serpent me beguiled  and i did eat .', 'which when the lord god heard  without delay to judgement he proceeded on the accused serpent  though brute  unable to transfer the guilt on him  who made him

they not deal worse with his followers than with him they dealt ', 'be sure they will  said the angel  but from heaven he to his own a comforter will send  the promise of the father  who shall dwell his spirit within them  and the law of faith  working through love  upon their hearts shall write  to guide them in all truth  and also arm with spiritual armour  able to resist satan  s assaults  and

persecutors  for the spirit  poured first on his apostles  whom he sends to evangelize the nations  then on all baptized  shall them with wonderous gifts endue to speak all tongues  and do all miracles  as did their lord before them .', 'thus they win great numbers of each nation to receive with joy the tidings brought from heaven  at length their ministry performed  and race well run

advantages shall turn of lucre and ambition  and the truth with superstitions and traditions taint  left only in those written records pure  though not but by the spirit understood .', 'then shall they seek to avail themselves of names  places  and titles  and with these to join secular power  though feigning still to act by spiritual  to themselves appropriating the spirit of god  promised

invented nearly everything in it .', 'every sort of tool or apparatus had  in consequence  to the full  that fantastic and distorted look which belongs to the miracles of science .', 'for the world of science and evolution is far more nameless and elusive and like a dream than the world of poetry and religion  since in the latter images and ideas remain themselves eternally  while it is the whole idea of evolution that identities melt into each other as they do in a nightmare .', 'all the tools of professor lucifer were the ancient human tools gone mad  grown into unrecognizable shapes  forgetful of their origin  forgetful of their names .', 'that thing which looked like an enormous key with three wheels was really a patent and very deadly revolver .', 'that object which seemed to be created by the entanglement of two corkscrews was really the key .', 'the thing which might have been mistaken for a tricycle turned upside  down was the inexpressibly important instrument to which the corkscrew was the key .', 'all these things  as i say  the professor had invented  he had invented everything in the flying ship  with the exception  perhaps  of himself .', 'this he had been born too late actually to inaugurate  but he believed at least  that he had considerably improved it .', 'there was  however  another man on board  so to speak  at the time .', 'him  also  by a curious coincidence  the professor had not invented  and him he had not even very greatly improved  though he had fished him up with a lasso out of his own back garden  in western bulgaria  with the pure object of improving him .', 'he was an exceedingly holy man  almost entirely covered with white hair .', 'you could see nothing but his eyes  and he seemed to talk with them .', 'a monk of immense learning and acute intellect he had made himself happy in a little stone hut and a little stony garden in the balkans  chiefly by writing the most crushing refutations of exposures of certain heresies  the last professors of which had been burnt  generally by each other  precisely    years previously .', 'they were really very plausible and thoughtful heresies  and it was really a creditable or even glorious circumstance  that the old monk had been intellectual enough to detect their fallacy  the only misfortune was that nobody in the modern world was intellectual enough even to understand their argument .', 'the old monk  one of whose names was michael  and the other a name quite impossible to remember or repeat in our western civilization  had  however  as i have said  made himself quite happy while he was in a mountain hermitage in the society of wild animals .', 'and now that his luck had lifted him above all the mountains in the society of a wild physicist  he made himself happy still .', ' i have no intention  my good michael  said professor lucifer   of endeavouring to convert you by argument .', 'the imbecility of your traditions can be quite finally exhibited to anybody with mere ordinary knowledge of the world  the same kind of knowledge which teaches us not to sit in draughts or not to encourage friendliness in impecunious people .', 'it is folly to talk of this or that demonstrating the rationalist philosophy .', 'everything demonstrates it .', 'rubbing shoulders with men of all kinds ', ' you will forgive me  said the monk  meekly from under loads of white beard   but i fear i do not understand  was it in order that i might rub my shoulder against men of all kinds that you put me inside this thing ', ' an entertaining retort  in the narrow and deductive manner of the middle ages  replied the professor  calmly   but even upon your own basis i will illustrate my point .', 'we are up in the sky .', 'in your religion and all the religions  as far as i know  and i know everything  the sky is made the symbol of everything that is sacred and merciful .', 'well  now you are in the sky  you know better .', 'phrase it how you like  twist it how you like  you know that you know better .', 'you know what are a man  s real feelings about the heavens  when he finds himself alone in the heavens  surrounded by the heavens .', 'you know the truth  and the truth is this .', 'the heavens are evil  the sky is evil  the stars are evil .', 'this mere space  this mere quantity  terrifies a man more than tigers or the terrible plague .', 'you know that since our science has spoken  the bottom has fallen out of the universe .', 'now  heaven is the hopeless thing  more hopeless than any hell .', 'now  if there be any comfort for all your miserable progeny of morbid apes  it must be in the earth  underneath you  under the roots of the grass  in the place where hell was of old .', 'the fiery crypts  the lurid cellars of the underworld  to which you once condemned the wicked  are hideous enough  but at least they are more homely than the heaven in which we ride .', 'and the time will come when you will all hide in them  to escape the horror of the stars .', ' i hope you will excuse my interrupting you  said michael  with a slight cough   but i have always noticed ', ' go on  pray go on  said professor lucifer  radiantly   i really like to draw out your simple ideas .', ' well  the fact is  said the other   that much as i admire your rhetoric and the rhetoric of your school  from a purely verbal point of view  such little study of you and your school in human history as i have been enabled to make has led me to  er  rather singular conclusion  which i find great difficulty in expressing  especially in a foreign language .', ' come  come  said the professor  encouragingly   i  ll help you out .', 'how did my view strike you ', ' well  the truth is  i know i don  t express it properly  but somehow it seemed to me that you always convey ideas of that kind with most eloquence  when  er  when ', ' oh ', 'get on  cried lucifer  boisterously .', ' well  in point of fact when your flying ship is just going to run into something .', 'i thought you wouldn  t mind my mentioning it  but it  s running into something now .', 'lucifer exploded with an oath and leapt erect  leaning hard upon the handle that acted as a helm to the vessel .', 'for the last ten minutes they had been shooting downwards into great cracks and caverns of cloud .', 'now  through a sort of purple haze  could be seen comparatively near to them what seemed to be the upper part of a huge  dark orb or sphere  islanded in a sea of cloud .', 'the professor  s eyes were blazing like a maniac  s .', ' it is a new world  he cried  with a dreadful mirth .', ' it is a new planet and it shall bear my name .', 'this star and not that other vulgar one shall be  lucifer  sun of the morning .', 'here we will have no chartered lunacies  here we will have no gods .', 'here man shall be as innocent as the daisies  as innocent and as cruel  here the intellect ', ' there seems  said michael  timidly   to be something sticking up in the middle of it .', ' so there is  said the professor  leaning over the side of the ship  his spectacles shining with intellectual excitement .', ' what can it be ', 'it might of course be merely a ', 'then a shriek indescribable broke out of him of a sudden  and he flung up his arms like a lost spirit .', 'the monk took the helm in a tired way  he did not seem much astonished for he came from an ignorant part of the world in which it is not uncommon for lost spirits to shriek when they see the curious shape which the professor had just seen on the top of the mysterious ball  but he took the helm only just in time  and by driving it hard to the left he prevented the flying ship from smashing into st . paul  s cathedral .', 'a plain of sad  coloured cloud lay along the level of the top of the cathedral dome  so that the ball and the cross looked like a buoy riding on a leaden sea .', 'as the flying ship swept towards it  this plain of cloud looked as dry and definite and rocky as any grey desert .', 'hence it gave to the mind and body a sharp and unearthly sensation when the ship cut and sank into the cloud as into any common mist  a thing without resistance .', 'there was  as it were  a deadly shock in the fact that there was no shock .', 'it was as if they had cloven into ancient cliffs like so much butter .', 'but sensations awaited them which were much stranger than those of sinking through the solid earth .', 'for a moment their eyes and nostrils were stopped with darkness and opaque cloud  then the darkness warmed into a kind of brown fog .', 'and far  far below them the brown fog fell until it warmed into fire .', 'through the dense london atmosphere they could see below them the flaming london lights  lights which lay beneath them in squares and oblongs of fire .', 'the fog and fire were mixed in a passionate vapour  you might say that the fog was drowning the flames  or you might say that the flames had set the fog on fire .', 'beside the ship and beneath it  for it swung just under the ball  the immeasurable dome itself shot out and down into the dark like a combination of voiceless cataracts .', 'or it was like some cyclopean sea  beast sitting above london and letting down its tentacles bewilderingly on every side  a monstrosity in that starless heaven .', 'for the clouds that belonged to london had closed over the heads of the voyagers sealing up the entrance of the upper air .', 'they had broken through a roof and come into a temple of twilight .', 'they were so near to the ball that lucifer leaned his hand against it  holding the vessel away  as men push a boat off from a bank .', 'above it the cross already draped in the dark mists of the borderland was shadowy and more awful in shape and size .', 'professor lucifer slapped his hand twice upon the surface of the great orb as if he were caressing some enormous animal .', ' this is the fellow  he said   this is the one for my money .', ' may i with all respect inquire  asked the old monk   what on earth you are talking about ', ' why this  cried lucifer  smiting the ball again   here is the only symbol  my boy .', 'so fat .', 'so satisfied .', 'not like that scraggy individual  stretching his arms in stark weariness .', 'and he pointed up to the cross  his face dark with a grin .', ' i was telling you just now  michael  that i can prove the best part of the rationalist case and the christian humbug from any symbol you liked to give me  from any instance i came across .', 'here is an instance with a vengeance .', 'what could possibly express your philosophy and my philosophy better than the shape of that cross and the shape of this ball ', 'this globe is reasonable  that cross is unreasonable .', 'it is a four  legged animal  with one leg longer than the others .', 'the globe is inevitable .', 'the cross is arbitrary .', 'above all the globe is at unity with itself  the cross is primarily and above all things at enmity with itself .', 'the cross is the conflict of two hostile lines  of irreconcilable direction .', 'that silent thing up there is essentially a collision  a crash  a struggle in stone .', 'pah ', 'that sacred symbol of yours has actually given its name to a description of desperation and muddle .', 'when we speak of men at once ignorant of each other and frustrated by each other  we say they are at cross  purposes .', 'away with the thing ', 'the very shape of it is a contradiction in terms .', ' what you say is perfectly true  said michael  with serenity .', ' but we like contradictions in terms .', 'man is a contradiction in terms  he is a beast whose superiority to other beasts consists in having fallen .', 'that cross is  as you say  an eternal collision  so am i .', 'that is a struggle in stone .', 'every form of life is a struggle in flesh .', 'the shape of the cross is irrational  just as the shape of the human animal is irrational .', 'you say the cross is a quadruped with one limb longer than the rest .', 'i say man is a quadruped who only uses two of his legs .', 'the professor frowned thoughtfully for an instant  and said   of course everything is relative  and i would not deny that the element of struggle and self  contradiction  represented by that cross  has a necessary place at a certain evolutionary stage .', 'but surely the cross is the lower development and the sphere the higher .', 'after all it is easy enough to see what is really wrong with wren  s architectural arrangement .', ' and what is that  pray ', 'inquired michael  meekly .', ' the cross is on top of the ball  said professor lucifer  simply .', ' that is surely wrong .', 'the ball should be on top of the cross .', 'the cross is a mere barbaric prop  the ball is perfection .', 'the cross at its best is but the bitter tree of man  s history  the ball is the rounded  the ripe and final fruit .', 'and the fruit should be at the top of the tree  not at the bottom of it .', ' oh ', 'said the monk  a wrinkle coming into his forehead   so you think that in a rationalistic scheme of symbolism the ball should be on top of the cross ', ' it sums up my whole allegory  said the professor .', ' well  that is really very interesting  resumed michael slowly   because i think in that case you would see a most singular effect  an effect that has generally been achieved by all those able and powerful systems which rationalism  or the religion of the ball  has produced to lead or teach mankind .', 'you would see  i think  that thing happen which is always the ultimate embodiment and logical outcome of your logical scheme .', ' what are you talking about ', 'asked lucifer .', ' what would happen ', ' i mean it would fall down  said the monk  looking wistfully into the void .', 'lucifer made an angry movement and opened his mouth to speak  but michael  with all his air of deliberation  was proceeding before he could bring out a word .', ' i once knew a man like you  lucifer  he said  with a maddening monotony and slowness of articulation .', ' he took this ', ' there is no man like me  cried lucifer  with a violence that shook the ship .', ' as i was observing  continued michael   this man also took the view that the symbol of christianity was a symbol of savagery and all unreason .', 'his history is rather amusing .', 'it is also a perfect allegory of what happens to rationalists like yourself .', 'he began  of course  by refusing to allow a crucifix in his house  or round his wife  s neck  or even in a picture .', 'he said  as you say  that it was an arbitrary and fantastic shape  that it was a monstrosity  loved because it was paradoxical .', 'then he began to grow fiercer and more eccentric  he would batter the crosses by the roadside  for he lived in a roman catholic country .', 'finally in a height of frenzy he climbed the steeple of the parish church and tore down the cross  waving it in the air  and uttering wild soliloquies up there under the stars .', 'then one still summer evening as he was wending his way homewards  along a lane  the devil of his madness came upon him with a violence and transfiguration which changes the world .', 'he was standing smoking  for a moment  in the front of an interminable line of palings  when his eyes were opened .', 'not a light shifted  not a leaf stirred  but he saw as if by a sudden change in the eyesight that this paling was an army of innumerable crosses linked together over hill and dale .', 'and he whirled up his heavy stick and went at it as if at an army .', 'mile after mile along his homeward path he broke it down and tore it up .', 'for he hated the cross and every paling is a wall of crosses .', 'when he returned to his house he was a literal madman .', 'he sat upon a chair and then started up from it for the cross  bars of the carpentry repeated the intolerable image .', 'he flung himself upon a bed only to remember that this  too  like all workmanlike things  was constructed on the accursed plan .', 'he broke his furniture because it was made of crosses .', 'he burnt his house because it was made of crosses .', 'he was found in the river .', 'lucifer was looking at him with a bitten lip .', ' is that story really true ', 'he asked .', ' oh  no  said michael  airily .', ' it is a parable .', 'it is a parable of you and all your rationalists .', 'you begin by breaking up the cross  but you end by breaking up the habitable world .', 'we leave you saying that nobody ought to join the church against his will .', 'when we meet you again you are saying that no one has any will to join it with .', 'we leave you saying that there is no such place as eden .', 'we find you saying that there is no such place as ireland .', 'you start by hating the irrational and you come to hate everything  for everything is irrational and so ', 'lucifer leapt upon him with a cry like a wild beast  s .', ' ah  he screamed   to every man his madness .', 'you are mad on the cross .', 'let it save you .', 'and with a herculean energy he forced the monk backwards out of the reeling car on to the upper part of the stone ball .', 'michael  with as abrupt an agility  caught one of the beams of the cross and saved himself from falling .', 'at the same instant lucifer drove down a lever and the ship shot up with him in it alone .', ' ha ', 'ha ', 'he yelled   what sort of a support do you find it  old fellow ', ' for practical purposes of support  replied michael grimly   it is at any rate a great deal better than the ball .', 'may i ask if you are going to leave me here ', ' yes  yes .', 'i mount ', 'i mount ', 'cried the professor in ungovernable excitement .', ' altiora peto .', 'my path is upward .', ' how often have you told me  professor  that there is really no up or down in space ', 'said the monk .', ' i shall mount up as much as you will .', ' indeed  said lucifer  leering over the side of the flying ship .', ' may i ask what you are going to do ', 'the monk pointed downward at ludgate hill .', ' i am going  he said   to climb up into a star .', 'those who look at the matter most superficially regard paradox as something which belongs to jesting and light journalism .', 'paradox of this kind is to be found in the saying of the dandy  in the decadent comedy   life is much too important to be taken seriously .', 'those who look at the matter a little more deeply or delicately see that paradox is a thing which especially belongs to all religions .', 'paradox of this kind is to be found in such a saying as  the meek shall inherit the earth .', 'but those who see and feel the fundamental fact of the matter know that paradox is a thing which belongs not to religion only  but to all vivid and violent practical crises of human living .', 'this kind of paradox may be clearly perceived by anybody who happens to be hanging in mid  space  clinging to one arm of the cross of st . paul  s .', 'father michael in spite of his years  and in spite of his asceticism  or because of it  for all i know  was a very healthy and happy old gentleman .', 'and as he swung on a bar above the sickening emptiness of air  he realized  with that sort of dead detachment which belongs to the brains of those in peril  the deathless and hopeless contradiction which is involved in the mere idea of courage .', 'he was a happy and healthy old gentleman and therefore he was quite careless about it .', 'and he felt as every man feels in the taut moment of such terror that his chief danger was terror itself  his only possible strength would be a coolness amounting to carelessness  a carelessness amounting almost to a suicidal swagger .', 'his one wild chance of coming out safely would be in not too desperately desiring to be safe .', 'there might be footholds down that awful facade  if only he could not care whether they were footholds or no .', 'if he were foolhardy he might escape  if he were wise he would stop where he was till he dropped from the cross like a stone .', 'and this antinomy kept on repeating itself in his mind  a contradiction as large and staring as the immense contradiction of the cross  he remembered having often heard the words   whosoever shall lose his life the same shall save it .', 'he remembered with a sort of strange pity that this had always been made to mean that whoever lost his physical life should save his spiritual life .', 'now he knew the truth that is known to all fighters  and hunters  and climbers of cliffs .', 'he knew that even his animal life could only be saved by a considerable readiness to lose it .', 'some will think it improbable that a human soul swinging desperately in mid  air should think about philosophical inconsistencies .', 'but such extreme states are dangerous things to dogmatize about .', 'frequently they produce a certain useless and joyless activity of the mere intellect  thought not only divorced from hope but even from desire .', 'and if it is impossible to dogmatize about such states  it is still more impossible to describe them .', 'to this spasm of sanity and clarity in michael  s mind succeeded a spasm of the elemental terror  the terror of the animal in us which regards the whole universe as its enemy  which  when it is victorious  has no pity  and so  when it is defeated has no imaginable hope .', 'of that ten minutes of terror it is not possible to speak in human words .', 'but then again in that damnable darkness there began to grow a strange dawn as of grey and pale silver .', 'and of this ultimate resignation or certainty it is even less possible to write  it is something stranger than hell itself  it is perhaps the last of the secrets of god .', 'at the highest crisis of some incurable anguish there will suddenly fall upon the man the stillness of an insane contentment .', 'it is not hope  for hope is broken and romantic and concerned with the future  this is complete and of the present .', 'it is not faith  for faith by its very nature is fierce  and as it were at once doubtful and defiant  but this is simply a satisfaction .', 'it is not knowledge  for the intellect seems to have no particular part in it .', 'nor is it  as the modern idiots would certainly say it is  a mere numbness or negative paralysis of the powers of grief .', 'it is not negative in the least  it is as positive as good news .', 'in some sense  indeed  it is good news .', 'it seems almost as if there were some equality among things  some balance in all possible contingencies which we are not permitted to know lest we should learn indifference to good and evil  but which is sometimes shown to us for an instant as a last aid in our last agony .', 'michael certainly could not have given any sort of rational account of this vast unmeaning satisfaction which soaked through him and filled him to the brim .', 'he felt with a sort of half  witted lucidity that the cross was there  and the ball was there  and the dome was there  that he was going to climb down from them  and that he did not mind in the least whether he was killed or not .', 'this mysterious mood lasted long enough to start him on his dreadful descent and to force him to continue it .', 'but six times before he reached the highest of the outer galleries terror had returned on him like a flying storm of darkness and thunder .', 'by the time he had reached that place of safety he almost felt  as in some impossible fit of drunkenness  that he had two heads  one was calm  careless  and efficient  the other saw the danger like a deadly map  was wise  careful  and useless .', 'he had fancied that he would have to let himself vertically down the face of the whole building .', 'when he dropped into the upper gallery he still felt as far from the terrestrial globe as if he had only dropped from the sun to the moon .', 'he paused a little  panting in the gallery under the ball  and idly kicked his heels  moving a few yards along it .', 'and as he did so a thunderbolt struck his soul .', 'a man  a heavy  ordinary man  with a composed indifferent face  and a prosaic sort of uniform  with a row of buttons  blocked his way .', 'michael had no mind to wonder whether this solid astonished man  with the brown moustache and the nickel buttons  had also come on a flying ship .', 'he merely let his mind float in an endless felicity about the man .', 'he thought how nice it would be if he had to live up in that gallery with that one man for ever .', 'he thought how he would luxuriate in the nameless shades of this man  s soul and then hear with an endless excitement about the nameless shades of the souls of all his aunts and uncles .', 'a moment before he had been dying alone .', 'now he was living in the same world with a man  an inexhaustible ecstasy .', 'in the gallery below the ball father michael had found that man who is the noblest and most divine and most lovable of all men  better than all the saints  greater than all the heroes  man friday .', 'in the confused colour and music of his new paradise  michael heard only in a faint and distant fashion some remarks that this beautiful solid man seemed to be making to him  remarks about something or other being after hours and against orders .', 'he also seemed to be asking how michael  got up  there .', 'this beautiful man evidently felt as michael did that the earth was a star and was set in heaven .', 'at length michael sated himself with the mere sensual music of the voice of the man in buttons .', 'he began to listen to what he said  and even to make some attempt at answering a question which appeared to have been put several times and was now put with some excess of emphasis .', 'michael realized that the image of god in nickel buttons was asking him how he had come there .', 'he said that he had come in lucifer  s ship .', 'on his giving this answer the demeanour of the image of god underwent a remarkable change .', 'from addressing michael gruffly  as if he were a malefactor  he began suddenly to speak to him with a sort of eager and feverish amiability as if he were a child .', 'he seemed particularly anxious to coax him away from the balustrade .', 'he led him by the arm towards a door leading into the building itself  soothing him all the time .', 'he gave what even michael  slight as was his knowledge of the world  felt to be an improbable account of the sumptuous pleasures and varied advantages awaiting him downstairs .', 'michael followed him  however  if only out of politeness  down an apparently interminable spiral of staircase .', 'at one point a door opened .', 'michael stepped through it  and the unaccountable man in buttons leapt after him and pinioned him where he stood .', 'but he only wished to stand  to stand and stare .', 'he had stepped as it were into another infinity  out under the dome of another heaven .', 'but this was a dome of heaven made by man .', 'the gold and green and crimson of its sunset were not in the shapeless clouds but in shapes of cherubim and seraphim  awful human shapes with a passionate plumage .', 'its stars were not above but far below  like fallen stars still in unbroken constellations  the dome itself was full of darkness .', 'and far below  lower even than the lights  could be seen creeping or motionless  great black masses of men .', 'the tongue of a terrible organ seemed to shake the very air in the whole void  and through it there came up to michael the sound of a tongue more terrible  the dreadful everlasting voice of man  calling to his gods from the beginning to the end of the world .', 'michael felt almost as if he were a god  and all the voices were hurled at him .', ' no  the pretty things aren  t here  said the demi  god in buttons  caressingly .', ' the pretty things are downstairs .', 'you come along with me .', 'there  s something that will surprise you downstairs  something you want very much to see .', 'evidently the man in buttons did not feel like a god  so michael made no attempt to explain his feelings to him  but followed him meekly enough down the trail of the serpentine staircase .', 'he had no notion where or at what level he was .', 'he was still full of the cold splendour of space  and of what a french writer has brilliantly named the  vertigo of the infinite  when another door opened  and with a shock indescribable he found himself on the familiar level  in a street full of faces  with the houses and even the lamp  posts above his head .', 'he felt suddenly happy and suddenly indescribably small .', 'he fancied he had been changed into a child again  his eyes sought the pavement seriously as children  s do  as if it were a thing with which something satisfactory could be done .', 'he felt the full warmth of that pleasure from which the proud shut themselves out  the pleasure which not only goes with humiliation  but which almost is humiliation .', 'men who have escaped death by a hair have it  and men whose love is returned by a woman unexpectedly  and men whose sins are forgiven them .', 'everything his eye fell on it feasted on  not aesthetically  but with a plain  jolly appetite as of a boy eating buns .', 'he relished the squareness of the houses  he liked their clean angles as if he had just cut them with a knife .', 'the lit squares of the shop windows excited him as the young are excited by the lit stage of some promising pantomime .', 'he happened to see in one shop which projected with a bulging bravery on to the pavement some square tins of potted meat  and it seemed like a hint of a hundred hilarious high teas in a hundred streets of the world .', 'he was  perhaps  the happiest of all the children of men .', 'for in that unendurable instant when he hung  half slipping  to the ball of st . paul  s  the whole universe had been destroyed and re  created .', 'suddenly through all the din of the dark streets came a crash of glass .', 'with that mysterious suddenness of the cockney mob  a rush was made in the right direction  a dingy office  next to the shop of the potted meat .', 'the pane of glass was lying in splinters about the pavement .', 'and the police already had their hands on a very tall young man  with dark  lank hair and dark  dazed eyes  with a grey plaid over his shoulder  who had just smashed the shop window with a single blow of his stick .', ' i  d do it again  said the young man  with a furious white face .', ' anybody would have done it .', 'did you see what it said ', 'i swear i  d do it again .', 'then his eyes encountered the monkish habit of michael  and he pulled off his grey tam  o  shanter with the gesture of a catholic .', ' father  did you see what they said ', 'he cried  trembling .', ' did you see what they dared to say ', 'i didn  t understand it at first .', 'i read it half through before i broke the window .', 'michael felt he knew not how .', 'the whole peace of the world was pent up painfully in his heart .', 'the new and childlike world which he had seen so suddenly  men had not seen at all .', 'here they were still at their old bewildering  pardonable  useless quarrels  with so much to be said on both sides  and so little that need be said at all .', 'a fierce inspiration fell on him suddenly  he would strike them where they stood with the love of god .', 'they should not move till they saw their own sweet and startling existence .', 'they should not go from that place till they went home embracing like brothers and shouting like men delivered .', 'from the cross from which he had fallen fell the shadow of its fantastic mercy  and the first three words he spoke in a voice like a silver trumpet  held men as still as stones .', 'perhaps if he had spoken there for an hour in his illumination he might have founded a religion on ludgate hill .', 'but the heavy hand of his guide fell suddenly on his shoulder .', ' this poor fellow is dotty  he said good  humouredly to the crowd .', ' i found him wandering in the cathedral .', 'says he came in a flying ship .', 'is there a constable to spare to take care of him ', 'there was a constable to spare .', 'two other constables attended to the tall young man in grey  a fourth concerned himself with the owner of the shop  who showed some tendency to be turbulent .', 'they took the tall young man away to a magistrate  whither

atheist had for some years past become less and less prominently interesting as a feature of ludgate hill .', 'the paper was unsuited to the atmosphere .', 'it showed an interest in the bible unknown

fierce and final demands as to what noah in the ark did with the neck of the giraffe .', 'it was in vain that he asked violently  as for the last time  how the statement  god is spirit  could be reconciled with the statement  the earth is his footstool .', 'it was in vain that he cried with an accusing energy that the bishop of london was paid l   a year for pretending to believe that the whale swallowed jonah .', 'it was in vain that he hung in conspicuous places the most thrilling scientific calculations about the width of the throat of a whale .', 'was it nothing to them all they that passed by ', 'did his sudden and splendid and truly sincere indignation never stir any of the people pouring down ludgate hill ', 'never .', 'the little man who edited the atheist would rush from his shop on starlit evenings and shake his fist at st . paul  s in the passion of his holy war upon the holy place .', 'he might have spared his emotion .', 'the cross at the top of st . paul  s and the atheist shop at the foot of it were alike remote from the world .', 'the shop and the cross were equally uplifted and alone in the empty heavens .', 'to the little man who edited the atheist  a fiery little scotchman  with fiery  red hair and beard  going by the name of turnbull  all this decline in public importance seemed not so much sad or even mad  but merely bewildering and unaccountable .', 'he had said the worst thing that could be said  and it seemed accepted and ignored like the ordinary second best of the politicians .', 'every day his blasphemies looked more glaring  and every day the dust lay thicker upon them .', 'it made him feel as if he were moving in a world of idiots .', 'he seemed among a race of men who smiled when told of their own death  or looked vacantly at the day of judgement .', 'year after year went by  and year after year the death of god in a shop in ludgate became a less and less important occurrence .', 'all the forward men of his age discouraged turnbull .', 'the socialists said he was cursing priests when he should be cursing capitalists .', 'the artists said that the soul was most spiritual  not when freed from religion

plaid  and he smashed the window .', 'he was a young man  born in the bay of arisaig  opposite rum and the isle of skye .', 'his high  hawklike features and snaky black hair bore the mark of that unknown historic thing which is crudely called celtic  but which is probably far older than the celts  whoever they were .', 'he was in name and stock a highlander of the macdonalds  but his family took  as was common in such cases  the name of a subordinate sept as a surname  and for all the purposes which could be answered in london  he called himself evan macian .', 'he had been brought up in some loneliness and seclusion as a strict roman catholic  in the midst of that little wedge of roman catholics which is driven into the western highlands .', 'and he had found his way as far as fleet street  seeking some half  promised employment  without having properly realized that there were in the world any people who were not roman catholics .', 'he had uncovered himself for a few moments before the statue of queen anne  in front of st . paul  s cathedral  under the firm impression that it was a figure of the virgin mary .', 'he was somewhat surprised at the lack of deference shown to the figure by the people bustling by .', 'he did not understand that their one essential historical principle  the one law truly graven on their hearts  was the great and comforting statement that queen anne is dead .', 'this faith was as fundamental as his faith  that our lady was alive .', 'any persons he had talked to since he had touched the fringe of our fashion or civilization had been by a coincidence  sympathetic or hypocritical .', 'or if they had spoken some established blasphemies  he had been unable to understand them merely owing to the preoccupied satisfaction of his mind .',

of his little village began to climb quite suddenly and seemed resolved to go to heaven .', 'the sky seemed to fall down towards the hills  the hills took hold upon the sky .', 'in the sumptuous sunset of gold and purple and peacock green cloudlets and islets were the same .', 'evan lived like a man walking on a borderland  the borderland between this world and another .', 'like so many men and nations who grow up with nature and the common things  he understood the supernatural before he understood the natural .', 'he had looked at dim angels standing knee  deep in the grass before he had looked at the grass .', 'he knew that our lady  s robes were blue before he knew the wild roses round her feet were red .', 'the deeper his memory plunged into the dark house of childhood the nearer and nearer he came to the things that cannot be named .', 'all through his life he thought of the daylight world as a sort of divine debris  the broken remainder of his first vision .', 'the skies and mountains were the splendid off  scourings of another place .', 'the stars were lost jewels of the queen .', 'our lady had gone and left the stars by accident .', 'his private tradition was equally wild and unworldly .', 'his great  grandfather had been cut down at culloden  certain in his last instant that god would restore the king .', 'his grandfather  then a boy of ten  had taken the terrible claymore from the hand of the dead and hung it up in his house  burnishing it and sharpening it for sixty years  to be ready for the next rebellion .', 'his father  the youngest son and the last left alive  had refused to attend on queen victoria in scotland .', 'and evan himself had been of one piece with his progenitors  and was not dead with them  but alive in the twentieth century .', 'he was not in the least the pathetic jacobite of whom we read  left behind by a final advance of all things .', 'he was  in his own fancy  a conspirator  fierce and up to date .', 'in the long  dark afternoons of the highland winter  he plotted and fumed in the dark .', 'he drew plans of the capture of london on the desolate sand of arisaig .', 'when he came up to capture london  it was not with an army of white cockades  but with a stick and a satchel .', 'london overawed him a little  not because he thought it grand or even terrible  but because it bewildered him  it was not the golden city or even hell  it was limbo .', 'he had one shock of sentiment  when he turned that wonderful corner of fleet street and saw st . paul  s sitting in the sky .', ' ah  he said  after a long pause   that sort of thing was built under the stuarts ', 'then with a sour grin he asked himself what was the corresponding monument of the brunswicks and the protestant constitution .', 'after some warning  he selected a sky  sign of some pill .', 'half an hour afterwards his emotions left him with an emptied mind on the same spot .', 'and it was in a mood of mere idle investigation that he happened to come to a standstill opposite the office of the atheist .', 'he did not see the word  atheist  or if he did  it is quite possible that he did not know the meaning of the word .', 'even as it was  the document would not have shocked even the innocent highlander  but for the troublesome and quite unforeseen fact that the innocent highlander read it stolidly to the end  a thing unknown among the most enthusiastic subscribers to the paper  and calculated in any case to create a new situation .', 'with a smart journalistic instinct characteristic of all his school  the editor of the atheist had put first in his paper and most prominently in his window an article called  the mesopotamian mythology and its effects on syriac folk lore .', 'mr . evan macian began to read this quite idly  as he would have read a public statement beginning with a young girl dying in brighton and ending with bile beans .', 'he received the very considerable amount of information accumulated by the author with that tired clearness of the mind which children have on heavy summer afternoons  that tired clearness which leads them to go on asking questions long after they have lost interest in the subject and are as bored as their nurse .', 'the streets were full of people and empty of adventures .', 'he might as well know about the gods of mesopotamia as not  so he flattened his long  lean face against the dim bleak pane of the window and read all there was to read about mesopotamian gods .', 'he read how the mesopotamians had a god named sho  sometimes pronounced ji  and that he was described as being very powerful  a striking similarity to some expressions about jahveh  who is also described as having power .', 'evan had never heard of jahveh in his life  and imagining him to be some other mesopotamian idol  read on with a dull curiosity .', 'he learnt that the name sho  under its third form of psa  occurs in an early legend which describes how the deity  after the manner of jupiter on so many occasions  seduced a virgin and begat a hero .', 'this hero  whose name is not essential to our existence  was  it was said  the chief hero and saviour of the mesopotamian ethical scheme .', 'then followed a paragraph giving other examples of such heroes and saviours being born of some profligate intercourse between god and mortal .', 'then followed a paragraph  but evan did not understand it .', 'he read it again and then again .', 'then he did understand it .', 'the glass fell in ringing fragments on to the pavement  and evan sprang over the barrier into the shop  brandishing his stick .', ' what is this ', 'cried little mr . turnbull  starting up with hair aflame .', ' how dare you break my window ', ' because it was the quickest cut to you  cried evan  stamping .', ' stand up and fight  you crapulous coward .', 'you dirty lunatic  stand up  will you ', 'have you any weapons here ', ' are you mad ', 'asked turnbull  glaring .', ' are you ', 'cried evan .', ' can you be anything else when you plaster your own house with that god  defying filth ', 'stand up and fight  i say .', 'a great light like dawn came into mr . turnbull  s face .', 'behind his red hair and beard he turned deadly pale with pleasure .', 'here  after twenty lone years of useless toil  he had his reward .', 'someone was angry with the paper .', 'he bounded to his feet like a boy  he saw a new youth opening before him .', 'and as not unfrequently happens to middle  aged gentlemen when they see a new youth opening before them  he found himself in the presence of the police .', 'the policemen  after some ponderous questionings  collared both the two enthusiasts .', 'they were more respectful  however  to the young man who had smashed the window  than to the miscreant who had had his window smashed .', 'there was an air of refined mystery about evan macian  which did not exist in the irate little shopkeeper  an air of refined mystery which appealed to the policemen  for policemen  like most other english types  are at once snobs and poets .', 'macian might possibly be a gentleman  they felt  the editor manifestly was not .', 'and the editor  s fine rational republican appeals to his respect for law  and his ardour to be tried by his fellow citizens  seemed to the police quite as much gibberish as evan  s mysticism could have done .', 'the police were not used to hearing principles  even the principles of their own existence .', 'the police magistrate  before whom they were hurried and tried  was a mr . cumberland vane  a cheerful  middle  aged gentleman  honourably celebrated for the lightness of his sentences and the lightness of his conversation .', 'he occasionally worked himself up into a sort of theoretic rage about certain particular offenders  such as the men who took pokers to their wives  talked in a loose  sentimental way about the desirability of flogging them  and was hopelessly bewildered by the fact that the wives seemed even more angry with him than with their husbands .', 'he was a tall  spruce man  with a twist of black moustache and incomparable morning dress .', 'he looked like a gentleman  and yet  somehow  like a stage gentleman .', 'he had often treated serious crimes against mere order or property with a humane flippancy .', 'hence  about the mere breaking of an editor  s window  he was almost uproarious .', ' come  mr . macian  come  he said  leaning back in his chair   do you generally enter you friends  houses by walking through the glass ', ' laughter .', ' he is not my friend  said evan  with the stolidity of a dull child .', ' not your friend  eh ', 'said the magistrate  sparkling .', ' is he your brother  in  law ', ' loud and prolonged laughter .', ' he is my enemy  said evan  simply   he is the enemy of god .', 'mr . vane shifted sharply in his seat  dropping the eye  glass out of his eye in a momentary and not unmanly embarrassment .', ' you mustn  t talk like that here  he said  roughly  and in a kind of hurry   that has nothing to do with us .', 'evan opened his great  blue eyes   god  he began .', ' be quiet  said the magistrate  angrily   it is most undesirable that things of that sort should be spoken about  a  in public  and in an ordinary court of justice .', 'religion is  a  too personal a matter to be mentioned in such a place .', ' is it ', 'answered the highlander   then what did those policemen swear by just now ', ' that is no parallel  answered vane  rather irritably   of course there is a form of oath  to be taken reverently  reverently  and there  s an end of it .', 'but to talk in a public place about one  s most sacred and private sentiments  well  i call it bad taste .', ' slight applause .', 'i call it irreverent .', 'i call it irreverent  and i  m not specially orthodox either .', ' i see you are not  said evan   but i am .', ' we are wondering from the point  said the police magistrate  pulling himself together .', ' may i ask why you smashed this worthy citizen  s window ', 'evan turned a little pale at the mere memory  but he answered with the same cold and deadly literalism that he showed throughout .', ' because he blasphemed our lady .', ' i tell you once and for all  cried mr . cumberland vane  rapping his knuckles angrily on the table   i tell you  once and for all  my man  that i will not have you turning on any religious rant or cant here

said evan  with a slight smile .', ' eh  cried vane  glaring through his eye  glass .', ' you asked me why i broke his window  said macian  with a face of wood .', ' i answered   because he blasphemed our lady .', 'i had no other reason .', 'so i have no other answer .', 'vane continued to gaze at him with a sternness not habitual to him .', ' you are not going the right way to work  sir  he said  with severity .', ' you are not going the right way to work to  a  have your case treated with special consideration .', 'if you had simply expressed regret for what you had done  i should have been strongly inclined to dismiss the matter as an outbreak of temper .', 'even now  if you say that you are sorry i shall only ', ' but i am not in the least sorry  said evan   i am very pleased .', ' i really believe you are insane  said the stipendiary  indignantly  for he had really been doing his best as a good  natured man  to compose the dispute .', ' what conceivable right have you to break other people  s windows because their opinions do not agree with yours ', 'this man only gave expression to his sincere belief .', ' so did i  said the highlander .', ' and who are you ', 'exploded vane .', ' are your views necessarily the right ones ', 'are you necessarily in possession of the truth ', ' yes  said macian .', 'the magistrate broke into a contemptuous laugh .', ' oh  you want a nurse to look after you  he said .', ' you must pay l .', 'evan macian plunged his hands into his loose grey garment and drew out a queer looking leather purse .', 'it contained exactly twelve sovereigns .', 'he paid down the ten  coin by coin  in silence  and equally silently returned the remaining two to the receptacle .', 'then he said   may i say a word  your worship ', 'cumberland vane seemed half hypnotized with the silence and automatic movements of the stranger  he made a movement with his head which might have been either  yes  or  no .', ' i only wished to say  your worship  said macian  putting back the purse in his trouser pocket   that smashing that shop window was  i confess  a useless and rather irregular business .', 'it may be excused  however  as a mere preliminary to further proceedings  a sort of preface .', 'wherever and whenever i meet that man  and he pointed to the editor of the atheist   whether it be outside this door in ten minutes from now  or twenty years hence in some distant country  wherever and whenever i meet that man  i will fight him .', 'do not be afraid .', 'i will not rush at him like a bully  or bear him down with any brute superiority .', 'i will fight him like a gentleman  i will fight him as our fathers fought .', 'he shall choose how  sword or pistol  horse or foot .', 'but if he refuses  i will write his cowardice

have equally with the rich  which the lonely have equally with the man of many friends .', 'to me this whole strange world is homely  because in the heart of it there is a home  to me this cruel world

a bubble and be gone .', 'i could not live in that imbecile universe .', 'shall i not fight for my own existence ', 'the magistrate recovered his voice and his presence of mind .', 'the first part of the speech  the bombastic and brutally practical challenge  stunned him with surprise  but the rest of evan  s remarks  branching off as they did into theoretic phrases  gave his vague and very english mind  full of memories of the hedging and compromise in english public speaking  an indistinct sensation of relief  as if the man  though mad  were not so dangerous as he had thought .', 'he went into a sort of weary laughter .', ' for heaven  s sake  man  he said   don  t talk so much .', 'let other people have a chance  laughter .', 'i trust all that you said about asking mr . turnbull

.', ' certainly not  answered macian .', ' what has he to do with peace ', ' do you mean to say  began the magistrate   that you refuse to ... the voice of turnbull himself clove in for the first time

say that i think that it is highly probable that he will .', ' laughter .', 'but it takes two to make a duel  your worship  renewed laughter .', 'i do not in the least mind being described on every wall in the world as the coward who would not fight a man in fleet street  about whether the virgin mary had a parallel in mesopotamian mythology .', 'no  your worship .', 'you need not trouble to bind him over to keep the peace .', 'i bind myself over to keep the peace  and you may rest quite satisfied that there will be no duel with me in it .', 'mr . cumberland vane rolled about  laughing in a sort of relief .', ' you  re like a breath of april  sir  he cried .', ' you  re ozone after that fellow .', 'you  re perfectly right .', 'perhaps i have taken the thing too seriously .', 'i should love to see him sending you challenges and to see you smiling .', 'well  well .', 'evan went out of the court of justice free  but strangely shaken  like a sick man .', 'any punishment of suppression

really true that the whole modern world regarded his world as a bubble .', 'no cruelty could have shown it  but their kindness showed it with a ghastly clearness .', 'as he was brooding  he suddenly became conscious of a small  stern figure  fronting him in silence .', 'its eyes were grey and awful  and its beard red .', 'it was turnbull .', ' well  sir  said the editor of the atheist   where is

poetic instinct has named it  it made the mean pseudo  french bookshop  next but one to it  a shop packed with dreary indecency  show for a moment a kind of parisian colour .', 'and the shop that stood between the pawnshop and the shop of dreary indecency  showed with quite a blaze of old world beauty  for it was  by accident  a shop not unbeautiful in itself .', 'the front window had a glimmer of bronze and blue steel  lit  as by a few stars  by the sparks of what were alleged to be jewels  for it was in brief  a shop of bric  a  brac and old curiosities .', 'a row of half  burnished seventeenth  century swords ran like an ornate railing along the front of the window  behind was a darker glimmer of old oak and old armour  and higher up hung the most extraordinary looking south sea tools or utensils  whether designed for killing enemies or merely for cooking them  no mere white man could possibly conjecture .', 'but the romance of the eye  which really on this rich evening  clung about the shop  had its main source in the accident of two doors standing open  the front door that opened on the street and a back door that opened on an odd green square of garden  that the sun turned to a square of gold .', 'there is nothing more beautiful than thus to look as it were through the archway of a house  as if the open sky were an interior chamber  and the sun a secret lamp of the place .', 'i have suggested that the sunset light made everything lovely .', 'to say that it made the keeper of the curiosity shop lovely would be a tribute to it perhaps too extreme .', 'it would easily have made him beautiful if he had been merely squalid  if he had been a jew of the fagin type .', 'but he was a jew of another and much less admirable type  a jew with a very well  sounding name .', 'for though there are no hard tests for separating the tares and the wheat of any people  one rude but efficient guide is that the nice jew is called moses solomon  and the nasty jew is called thornton percy .', 'the keeper of the curiosity shop was of the thornton percy branch of the chosen people  he belonged to those lost ten tribes whose industrious object is to lose themselves .', 'he was a man still young  but already corpulent  with sleek dark hair  heavy handsome clothes  and a full  fat  permanent smile  which looked at the first glance kindly  and at the second cowardly .', 'the name over his shop was henry gordon  but two scotchmen who were in his shop that evening could come upon no trace of a scotch accent .', 'these two scotchmen in this shop were careful purchasers  but free  handed payers .', 'one of them who seemed to be the principal and the authority  whom  indeed  mr . henry gordon fancied he had seen somewhere before  was a small  sturdy fellow  with fine grey eyes  a square red tie and a square red beard  that he carried aggressively forward as if he defied anyone to pull it .', 'the other kept so much in the background in comparison that he looked almost ghostly in his grey cloak or plaid  a tall  sallow  silent young man .', 'the two scotchmen were interested in seventeenth  century swords .', 'they were fastidious about them .', 'they had a whole armoury of these weapons brought out and rolled clattering about the counter  until they found two of precisely the same length .', 'presumably they desired the exact symmetry for some decorative trophy .', 'even then they felt the points  poised the swords for balance and bent them in a circle to see that they sprang straight again  which  for decorative purposes  seems carrying realism rather far .', ' these will do  said the strange person with the red beard .', ' and perhaps i had better pay for them at once .', 'and as you are the challenger  mr . macian  perhaps you had better explain the situation .', 'the tall scotchman in grey took a step forward and spoke in a voice quite clear and bold  and yet somehow lifeless  like a man going through an ancient formality .', ' the fact is  mr . gordon  we have to place our honour in your hands .', 'words have passed between mr . turnbull and myself on a grave and invaluable matter  which can only be atoned for by fighting .', 'unfortunately  as the police are in some sense pursuing us  we are hurried  and must fight now and without seconds .', 'but if you will be so kind as to take us into your little garden and see far play  we shall feel how ', 'the shopman recovered himself from a stunning surprise and burst out ', ' gentlemen  are you drunk ', 'a duel ', 'a duel in my garden .', 'go home  gentlemen  go home .', 'why  what did you quarrel about ', ' we quarrelled  said evan  in the same dead voice   about religion .', 'the fat shopkeeper rolled about in his chair with enjoyment .', ' well  this is a funny game  he said .', ' so you want to commit murder on behalf of religion .', 'well  well my religion is a little respect for humanity  and ', ' excuse me  cut in turnbull  suddenly and fiercely  pointing towards the pawnbroker  s next door .', ' don  t you own that shop ', ' why  er  yes  said gordon .', ' and don  t you own that shop ', 'repeated the secularist  pointing backward to the pornographic bookseller .', ' what if i do ', ' why  then  cried turnbull  with grating contempt .', ' i will leave the religion of humanity confidently in your hands  but i am sorry i troubled you about such a thing as honour .', 'look here  my man .', 'i do believe in humanity .', 'i do believe in liberty .', 'my father died for it under the swords of the yeomanry .', 'i am going to die for it  if need be  under that sword on your counter .', 'but if there is one sight that makes me doubt it it is your foul fat face .', 'it is hard to believe you were not meant to be ruled like a dog or killed like a cockroach .', 'don  t try your slave  s philosophy on me .', 'we are going to fight  and we are going to fight in your garden  with your swords .', 'be still ', 'raise your voice above a whisper  and i run you through the body .', 'turnbull put the bright point of the sword against the gay waistcoat of the dealer  who stood choking with rage and fear  and an astonishment so crushing as to be greater than either .', ' macian  said turnbull  falling almost into the familiar tone of a business partner   macian  tie up this fellow and put a gag in his mouth .', 'be still  i say  or i kill you where you stand .', 'the man was too frightened to scream  but he struggled wildly  while evan macian  whose long  lean hands were unusually powerful  tightened some old curtain cords round him  strapped a rope gag in his mouth and rolled him on his back on the floor .', ' there  s nothing very strong here  said evan  looking about him .', ' i  m afraid he  ll work through that gag in half an hour or so .', ' yes  said turnbull   but one of us will be killed by that time .', ' well  let  s hope so  said the highlander  glancing doubtfully at the squirming thing on the floor .', ' and now  said turnbull  twirling his fiery moustache and fingering his sword   let us go into the garden .', 'what an exquisite summer evening ', 'macian said nothing  but lifting his sword from the counter went out into the sun .', 'the brilliant light ran along the blades  filling the channels of them with white fire  the combatants stuck their swords in the turf and took off their hats  coats  waistcoats  and boots .', 'evan said a short latin prayer to himself  during which turnbull made something of a parade of lighting a cigarette which he flung away the instant after  when he saw macian apparently standing ready .', 'yet macian was not exactly ready .', 'he stood staring like a man stricken with a trance .', ' what are you staring at ', 'asked turnbull .', ' do you see the bobbies ', ' i see jerusalem  said evan   all covered with the shields and standards of the saracens .', ' jerusalem ', 'said turnbull  laughing .', ' well  we  ve taken the only inhabitant into captivity .', 'and he picked up his sword and made it whistle like a boy  s wand .', ' i beg your pardon  said macian  dryly .', ' let us begin .', 'macian made a military salute with his weapon  which turnbull copied or parodied with an impatient contempt  and in the stillness of the garden the swords came together with a clear sound like a bell .', 'the instant the blades touched  each felt them tingle to their very points with a personal vitality  as if they were two naked nerves of steel .', 'evan had worn throughout an air of apathy  which might have been the stale apathy of one who wants nothing .', 'but it was indeed the more dreadful apathy of one who wants something and will care for nothing else .', 'and this was seen suddenly  for the instant evan engaged he disengaged and lunged with an infernal violence .', 'his opponent with a desperate promptitude parried and riposted  the parry only just succeeded  the riposte failed .', 'something big and unbearable seemed to have broken finally out of evan in that first murderous lunge  leaving him lighter and cooler and quicker upon his feet .', 'he fell to again  fiercely still  but now with a fierce caution .', 'the next moment turnbull lunged  macian seemed to catch the point and throw it away from him  and was thrusting back like a thunderbolt  when a sound paralysed him  another sound beside their ringing weapons .', 'turnbull  perhaps from an equal astonishment  perhaps from chivalry  stopped also and forebore to send his sword through his exposed enemy .', ' what  s that ', 'asked evan  hoarsely .', 'a heavy scraping sound  as of a trunk being dragged along a littered floor  came from the dark shop behind them .', ' the old jew has broken one of his strings  and he  s crawling about  said turnbull .', ' be quick ', 'we must finish before he gets his gag out .', ' yes  yes  quick ', 'on guard ', 'cried the highlander .', 'the blades crossed again with the same sound like song  and the men went to work again with the same white and watchful faces .', 'evan  in his impatience  went back a little to his wildness .', 'he made windmills  as the french duellists say  and though he was probably a shade the better fencer of the two  he found the other  s point pass his face twice so close as almost to graze his cheek .', 'the second time he realized the actual possibility of defeat and pulled himself together under a shock of the sanity of anger .', 'he narrowed  and  so to speak  tightened his operations  he fenced  as the swordsman  s boast goes  in a wedding ring  he turned turnbull  s thrusts with a maddening and almost mechanical click  like that of a machine .', 'whenever turnbull  s sword sought to go over that other mere white streak it seemed to be caught in a complex network of steel .', 'he turned one thrust  turned another  turned another .', 'then suddenly he went forward at the lunge with his whole living weight .', 'turnbull leaped back  but evan lunged and lunged and lunged again like a devilish piston rod or battering ram .', 'and high above all the sound of the struggle there broke into the silent evening a bellowing human voice  nasal  raucous  at the highest pitch of pain .', ' help ', 'help ', 'police ', 'murder ', 'murder ', 'the gag was broken  and the tongue of terror was loose .', ' keep on ', 'gasped turnbull .', ' one may be killed before they come .', 'the voice of the screaming shopkeeper was loud enough to drown not only the noise of the swords but all other noises around it  but even through its rending din there seemed to be some other stir or scurry .', 'and evan  in the very act of thrusting at turnbull  saw something in his eyes that made him drop his sword .', 'the atheist  with his grey eyes at their widest and wildest  was staring straight over his shoulder at the little archway of shop that opened on the street beyond .', 'and he saw the archway blocked and blackened with strange figures .', ' we must bolt  macian  he said abruptly .', ' and there isn  t a damned second to lose either .', 'do as i do .', 'with a bound he was beside the little cluster of his clothes and boots that lay on the lawn  he snatched them up  without waiting to put any of them on  and tucking his sword under his other arm  went wildly at the wall at the bottom of the garden and swung himself over it .', 'three seconds after he had alighted in his socks on the other side  macian alighted beside him  also in his socks and also carrying clothes and sword in a desperate bundle .', 'they were in a by  street  very lean and lonely itself  but so close to a crowded thoroughfare that they could see the vague masses of vehicles going by  and could even see an individual hansom cab passing the corner at the instant .', 'turnbull put his fingers to his mouth like a gutter  snipe and whistled twice .', 'even as he did so he could hear the loud voices of the neighbours and the police coming down the garden .', 'the hansom swung sharply and came tearing down the little lane at his call .', 'when the cabman saw his fares  however  two wild  haired men in their shirts and socks with naked swords under their arms  he not unnaturally brought his readiness to a rigid stop and stared suspiciously .', ' you talk to him a minute  whispered turnbull  and stepped back into the shadow of the wall .', ' we want you  said macian to the cabman  with a superb scotch drawl of indifference and assurance   to drive us to st . pancras station  verra quick .', ' very sorry  sir  said the cabman   but i  d like to know it was all right .', 'might i arst where you come from  sir ', 'a second after he spoke macian heard a heavy voice on the other side of the wall  saying   i suppose i  d better get over and look for them .', 'give me a back .', ' cabby  said macian  again assuming the most deliberate and lingering lowland scotch intonation   if ye  re really verra anxious to ken whar a  come fra  i  ll tell ye as a verra great secret .', 'a  come from scotland .', 'and a  m gaein  to st . pancras station .', 'open the doors  cabby .', 'the cabman stared  but laughed .', 'the heavy voice behind the wall said   now then  a better back this time  mr .', 'price .', 'and from the shadow of the wall turnbull crept out .', 'he had struggled wildly into his coat  leaving his waistcoat on the pavement  and he was with a fierce pale face climbing up the cab behind the cabman .', 'macian had no glimmering notion of what he was up to  but an instinct of discipline  inherited from a hundred men of war  made him stick to his own part and trust the other man  s .', ' open the doors  cabby  he repeated  with something of the obstinate solemnity of a drunkard   open the doors .', 'did ye no hear me say st . pancras station ', 'the top of a policeman  s helmet appeared above the garden wall .', 'the cabman did not see it  but he was still suspicious and began ', ' very sorry  sir  but ... and with that the catlike turnbull tore him out of his seat and hurled him into the street below  where he lay suddenly stunned .', ' give me his hat  said turnbull in a silver voice  that the other obeyed like a bugle .', ' and get inside with the swords .', 'and just as the red and raging face of a policeman appeared above the wall  turnbull struck the horse with a terrible cut of the whip and the two went whirling away like a boomerang .', 'they had spun through seven streets and three or four squares before anything further happened .', 'then  in the neighbourhood of maida vale  the driver opened the trap and talked through it in a manner not wholly common in conversations through that aperture .', ' mr . macian  he said shortly and civilly .', ' mr . turnbull  replied his motionless fare .', ' under circumstances such as those in which we were both recently placed there was no time for anything but very abrupt action .', 'i trust therefore that you have no cause to complain of me if i have deferred until this moment a consultation with you on our present position or future action .', 'our present position  mr . macian  i imagine that i am under no special necessity of describing .', 'we have broken the law and we are fleeing from its officers .', 'our future action is a thing about which i myself entertain sufficiently strong views  but i have no right to assume or to anticipate yours  though i may have formed a decided conception of your character and a decided notion of what they will probably be .', 'still  by every principle of intellectual justice  i am bound to ask you now and seriously whether you wish to continue our interrupted relations .', 'macian leant his white and rather weary face back upon the cushions in order to speak up through the open door .', ' mr . turnbull  he said   i have nothing to add to what i have said before .', 'it is strongly borne in upon me that you and i  the sole occupants of this runaway cab  are at this moment the two most important people in london  possibly in europe .', 'i have been looking at all the streets as we went past  i have been looking at all the shops as we went past  i have been looking at all the churches as we went past .', 'at first  i felt a little dazed with the vastness of it all .', 'i could not understand what it all meant .', 'but now i know exactly what it all means .', 'it means us .', 'this whole civilization is only a dream .', 'you and i are the realities .', ' religious symbolism  said mr . turnbull  through the trap   does not  as you are probably aware  appeal ordinarily to thinkers of the school to which i belong .', 'but in symbolism as you use it in this instance  i must  i think  concede a certain truth .', 'we must fight this thing out somewhere  because  as you truly say  we have found each other  s reality .', 'we must kill each other  or convert each other .', 'i used to think all christians were hypocrites  and i felt quite mildly towards them really .', 'but i know you are sincere  and my soul is mad against you .', 'in the same way you used  i suppose  to think that all atheists thought atheism would leave them free for immorality  and yet in your heart you tolerated them entirely .', 'now you know that i am an honest man  and you are mad against me  as i am against you .', 'yes  that  s it .', 'you can  t be angry with bad men .', 'but a good man in the wrong  why one thirsts for his blood .', 'yes  you open for me a vista of thought .', ' don  t run into anything  said evan  immovably .', ' there  s something in that view of yours  too  said turnbull  and shut down the trap .', 'they sped on through shining streets that shot by them like arrows .', 'mr . turnbull had evidently a great deal of unused practical talent which was unrolling itself in this ridiculous adventure .', 'they had got away with such stunning promptitude that the police chase had in all probability not even properly begun .', 'but in case it had  the amateur cabman chose his dizzy course through london with a strange dexterity .', 'he did not do what would have first occurred to any ordinary outsider desiring to destroy his tracks .', 'he did not cut into by  ways or twist his way through mean streets .', 'his amateur common sense told him that it was precisely the poor street  the side street  that would be likely to remember and report the passing of a hansom cab  like the passing of a royal procession .', 'he kept chiefly to the great roads  so full of hansoms that a wilder pair than they might easily have passed in the press .', 'in one of the quieter streets evan put on his boots .', 'towards the top of albany street the singular cabman again opened the trap .', ' mr . macian  he said   i understand that we have now definitely settled that in the conventional language honour is not satisfied .', 'our action must at least go further than it has gone under recent interrupted conditions .', 'that  i believe  is understood .', ' perfectly  replied the other with his bootlace in his teeth .', ' under those conditions  continued turnbull  his voice coming through the hole with a slight note of trepidation very unusual with him   i have a suggestion to make  if that can be called a suggestion  which has probably occurred to you as readily as to me .', 'until the actual event comes off we are practically in the position if not of comrades  at least of business partners .', 'until the event comes off  therefore i should suggest that quarrelling would be inconvenient and rather inartistic  while the ordinary exchange of politeness between man and man would be not only elegant but uncommonly practical .', ' you are perfectly right  answered macian  with his melancholy voice   in saying that all this has occurred to me .', 'all duellists should behave like gentlemen to each other .', 'but we  by the queerness of our position  are something much more than either duellists or gentlemen .', 'we are  in the oddest and most exact sense of the term  brothers  in arms .', ' mr . macian  replied turnbull  calmly   no more need be said .', 'and he closed the trap once more .', 'they had reached finchley road before he opened it again .', 'then he said   mr . macian  may i offer you a cigar .', 'it will be a touch of realism .', ' thank you  answered evan .', ' you are very kind .', 'and he began to smoke in the cab .', 'iv .', 'a discussion at dawn', 'the duellists had from their own point of view escaped or conquered the chief powers of the modern world .', 'they had satisfied the magistrate  they had tied the tradesman neck and heels  and they had left the police behind .', 'as far as their own feelings went they had melted into a monstrous sea  they were but the fare and driver of one of the million hansoms that fill london streets .', 'but they had forgotten something  they had forgotten journalism .', 'they had forgotten that there exists in the modern world  perhaps for the first time in history  a class of people whose interest is not that things should happen well or happen badly  should happen successfully or happen unsuccessfully  should happen to the advantage of this party or the advantage of that part  but whose interest simply is that things should happen .', 'it is the one great weakness of journalism as a picture of our modern existence  that it must be a picture made up entirely of exceptions .', 'we announce on flaring posters that a man has fallen off a scaffolding .', 'we do not announce on flaring posters that a man has not fallen off a scaffolding .', 'yet this latter fact is fundamentally more exciting  as indicating that that moving tower of terror and mystery  a man  is still abroad upon the earth .', 'that the man has not fallen off a scaffolding is really more sensational  and it is also some thousand times more common .', 'but journalism cannot reasonably be expected thus to insist upon the permanent miracles .', 'busy editors cannot be expected to put on their posters   mr . wilkinson still safe  or  mr . jones  of worthing  not dead yet .', 'they cannot announce the happiness of mankind at all .', 'they cannot describe all the forks that are not stolen  or all the marriages that are not judiciously dissolved .', 'hence the complete picture they give of life is of necessity fallacious  they can only represent what is unusual .', 'however democratic they may be  they are only concerned with the minority .', 'the incident of the religious fanatic who broke a window on ludgate hill was alone enough to set them up in good copy for the night .', 'but when the same man was brought before a magistrate and defied his enemy to mortal combat in the open court  then the columns would hardly hold the excruciating information  and the headlines were so large that there was hardly room for any of the text .', 'the daily telegraph headed a column   a duel on divinity  and there was a correspondence afterwards which lasted for months  about whether police magistrates ought to mention religion .', 'the daily mail in its dull  sensible way  headed the events   wanted to fight for the virgin .', 'mr . james douglas  in the star  presuming on his knowledge of philosophical and theological terms  described the christian  s outbreak under the title of  dualist and duellist .', 'the daily news inserted a colourless account of the matter  but was pursued and eaten up for some weeks  with letters from outlying ministers  headed  murder and mariolatry .', 'but the journalistic temperature was steadily and consistently heated by all these influences  the journalists had tasted blood  prospectively  and were in the mood for more  everything in the matter prepared them for further outbursts of moral indignation .', 'and when a gasping reporter rushed in in the last hours of the evening with the announcement that the two heroes of the police court had literally been found fighting in a london back garden  with a shopkeeper bound and gagged in the front of the house  the editors and sub  editors were stricken still as men are by great beatitudes .', 'the next morning  five or six of the great london dailies burst out simultaneously into great blossoms of eloquent leader  writing .', 'towards the end all the leaders tended to be the same  but they all began differently .', 'the daily telegraph  for instance began   there will be little difference among our readers or among all truly english and law  abiding men touching the  etc .', 'etc .', 'the daily mail said   people must learn  in the modern world  to keep their theological differences to themselves .', 'the fracas  etc .', 'etc .', 'the daily news started   nothing could be more inimical to the cause of true religion than  etc .', 'etc .', 'the times began with something about celtic disturbances of the equilibrium of empire  and the daily express distinguished itself splendidly by omitting altogether so controversial a matter and substituting a leader about goloshes .', 'and the morning after that  the editors and the newspapers were in such a state  that  as the phrase is  there was no holding them .', 'whatever secret and elvish thing it is that broods over editors and suddenly turns their brains  that thing had seized on the story of the broken glass and the duel in the garden .', 'it became monstrous and omnipresent  as do in our time the unimportant doings of the sect of the agapemonites  or as did at an earlier time the dreary dishonesties of the rhodesian financiers .', 'questions were asked about it  and even answered  in the house of commons .', 'the government was solemnly denounced in the papers for not having done something  nobody knew what  to prevent the window being broken .', 'an enormous subscription was started to reimburse mr . gordon  the man who had been gagged in the shop .', 'mr . macian  one of the combatants  became for some mysterious reason  singly and hugely popular as a comic figure in the comic papers and on the stage of the music hall .', 'he was always represented  in defiance of fact  with red whiskers  and a very red nose  and in full highland costume .', 'and a song  consisting of an unimaginable number of verses  in which his name was rhymed with flat iron  the british lion  sly  un  dandelion  spion  with kop in the next line  was sung to crowded houses every night .', 'the papers developed a devouring thirst for the capture of the fugitives  and when they had not been caught for forty  eight hours  they suddenly turned the whole matter into a detective mystery .', 'letters under the heading   where are they  poured in to every paper  with every conceivable kind of explanation  running them to earth in the monument  the twopenny tube  epping forest  westminster abbey  rolled up in carpets at shoolbreds  locked up in safes in chancery lane .', 'yes  the papers were very interesting  and mr . turnbull unrolled a whole bundle of them for the amusement of mr . macian as they sat on a high common to the north of london  in the coming of the white dawn .', 'the darkness in the east had been broken with a bar of grey  the bar of grey was split with a sword of silver and morning lifted itself laboriously over london .', 'from the spot where turnbull and macian were sitting on one of the barren steeps behind hampstead  they could see the whole of london shaping itself vaguely and largely in the grey and growing light  until the white sun stood over it and it lay at their feet  the splendid monstrosity that it is .', 'its bewildering squares and parallelograms were compact and perfect as a chinese puzzle  an enormous hieroglyphic which man must decipher or die .', 'there fell upon both of them  but upon turnbull more than the other  because he know more what the scene signified  that quite indescribable sense as of a sublime and passionate and heart  moving futility  which is never evoked by deserts or dead men or men neglected and barbarous  which can only be invoked by the sight of the enormous genius of man applied to anything other than the best .', 'turnbull  the old idealistic democrat  had so often reviled the democracy and reviled them justly for their supineness  their snobbishness  their evil reverence for idle things .', 'he was right enough  for our democracy has only one great fault  it is not democratic .', 'and after denouncing so justly average modern men for so many years as sophists and as slaves  he looked down from an empty slope in hampstead and saw what gods they are .', 'their achievement seemed all the more heroic and divine  because it seemed doubtful whether it was worth doing at all .', 'there seemed to be something greater than mere accuracy in making such a mistake as london .', 'and what was to be the end of it all ', 'what was to be the ultimate transformation of this common and incredible london man  this workman on a tram in battersea  his clerk on an omnibus in cheapside ', 'turnbull  as he stared drearily  murmured to himself the words of the old atheistic and revolutionary swinburne who had intoxicated his youth ', ' and still we ask if god or man can loosen thee lazarus  bid thee rise up republican  and save thyself and all of us .', 'but no disciple  s tongue can say if thou can  st take our sins away .', 'turnbull shivered slightly as if behind the earthly morning he felt the evening of the world  the sunset of so many hopes .', 'those words were from  songs before sunrise .', 'but turnbull  s songs at their best were songs after sunrise  and sunrise had been no such great thing after all .', 'turnbull shivered again in the sharp morning air .', 'macian was also gazing with his face towards the city  but there was that about his blind and mystical stare that told one  so to speak  that his eyes were turned inwards .', 'when turnbull said something to him about london  they seemed to move as at a summons and come out like two householders coming out into their doorways .', ' yes  he said  with a sort of stupidity .', ' it  s a very big place .', 'there was a somewhat unmeaning silence  and then macian said again ', ' it  s a very big place .', 'when i first came into it i was frightened of it .', 'frightened exactly as one would be frightened at the sight of a man forty feet high .', 'i am used to big things where i come from  big mountains that seem to fill god  s infinity  and the big sea that goes to the end of the world .', 'but then these things are all shapeless and confused things  not made in any familiar form .', 'but to see the plain  square  human things as large as that  houses so large and streets so large  and the town itself so large  was like having screwed some devil  s magnifying glass into one  s eye .', 'it was like seeing a porridge bowl as big as a house  or a mouse  trap made to catch elephants .', ' like the land of the brobdingnagians  said turnbull  smiling .', ' oh ', 'where is that ', 'said macian .', 'turnbull said bitterly   in a book  and the silence fell suddenly between them again .', 'they were sitting in a sort of litter on the hillside  all the things they had hurriedly collected  in various places  for their flight  were strewn indiscriminately round them .', 'the two swords with which they had lately sought each other  s lives were flung down on the grass at random  like two idle walking  sticks .', 'some provisions they had bought last night  at a low public house  in case of undefined contingencies  were tossed about like the materials of an ordinary picnic  here a basket of chocolate  and there a bottle of wine .', 'and to add to the disorder finally  there were strewn on top of everything  the most disorderly of modern things  newspapers  and more newspapers  and yet again newspapers  the ministers of the modern anarchy .', 'turnbull picked up one of them drearily  and took out a pipe .', ' there  s a lot about us  he said .', ' do you mind if i light up ', ' why should i mind ', 'asked macian .', 'turnbull eyed with a certain studious interest  the man who did not understand any of the verbal courtesies  he lit his pipe and blew great clouds out of it .', ' yes  he resumed .', ' the matter on which you and i are engaged is at this moment really the best copy in england .', 'i am a journalist  and i know .', 'for the first time  perhaps  for many generations  the english are really more angry about a wrong thing done in england than they are about a wrong thing done in france .', ' it is not a wrong thing  said macian .', 'turnbull laughed .', ' you seem unable to understand the ordinary use of the human language .', 'if i did not suspect that you were a genius  i should certainly know you were a blockhead .', 'i fancy we had better be getting along and collecting our baggage .', 'and he jumped up and began shoving the luggage into his pockets  or strapping it on to his back .', 'as he thrust a tin of canned meat  anyhow  into his bursting side pocket  he said casually ', ' i only meant that you and i are the most prominent people in the english papers .', ' well  what did you expect ', 'asked macian  opening his great grave blue eyes .', ' the papers are full of us  said turnbull  stooping to pick up one of the swords .', 'macian stooped and picked up the other .', ' yes  he said  in his simple way .', ' i have read what they have to say .', 'but they don  t seem to understand the point .', ' the point of what ', 'asked turnbull .', ' the point of the sword  said macian  violently  and planted the steel point in the soil like a man planting a tree .', ' that is a point  said turnbull  grimly   that we will discuss later .', 'come along .', 'turnbull tied the last tin of biscuits desperately to himself with string  and then spoke  like a diver girt for plunging  short and sharp .', ' now  mr . macian  you must listen to me .', 'you must listen to me  not merely because i know the country  which you might learn by looking at a map  but because i know the people of the country  whom you could not know by living here thirty years .', 'that infernal city down there is awake  and it is awake against us .', 'all those endless rows of windows and windows are all eyes staring at us .', 'all those forests of chimneys are fingers pointing at us  as we stand here on the hillside .', 'this thing has caught on .', 'for the next six mortal months they will think of nothing but us  as for six mortal months they thought of nothing but the dreyfus case .', 'oh  i know it  s funny .', 'they let starving children  who don  t want to die  drop by the score without looking round .', 'but because two gentlemen  from private feelings of delicacy  do want to die  they will mobilize the army and navy to prevent them .', 'for half a year or more  you and i  mr . macian  will be an obstacle to every reform in the british empire .', 'we shall prevent the chinese being sent out of the transvaal and the blocks being stopped in the strand .', 'we shall be the conversational substitute when anyone recommends home rule  or complains of sky signs .', 'therefore  do not imagine  in your innocence  that we have only to melt away among those english hills as a highland cateran might into your god  forsaken highland mountains .', 'we must be eternally on our guard  we must live the hunted life of two distinguished criminals .', 'we must expect to be recognized as much as if we were napoleon escaping from elba .', 'we must be prepared for our descriptions being sent to every tiny village  and for our faces being recognized by every ambitious policeman .', 'we must often sleep under the stars as if we were in africa .', 'last and most important we must not dream of effecting our  our final settlement  which will be a thing as famous as the phoenix park murders  unless we have made real and precise arrangements for our isolation  i will not say our safety .', 'we must not  in short  fight until we have thrown them off our scent  if only for a moment .', 'for  take my word for it  mr . macian  if the british public once catches us up  the british public will prevent the duel  if it is only by locking us both up in asylums for the rest of our days .', 'macian was looking at the horizon with a rather misty look .', ' i am not at all surprised  he said   at the world being against us .', 'it makes me feel i was right to ', ' yes ', 'said turnbull .', ' to smash your window  said macian .', ' i have woken up the world .', ' very well  then  said turnbull  stolidly .', ' let us look at a few final facts .', 'beyond that hill there is comparatively clear country .', 'fortunately  i know the part well  and if you will follow me exactly  and  when necessary  on your stomach  we may be able to get ten miles out of london  literally without meeting anyone at all  which will be the best possible beginning  at any rate .', 'we have provisions for at least two days and two nights  three days if we do it carefully .', 'we may be able to get fifty or sixty miles away without even walking into an inn door .', 'i have the biscuits and the tinned meat  and the milk .', 'you have the chocolate  i think ', 'and the brandy ', ' yes  said macian  like a soldier taking orders .', ' very well  then  come on .', 'march .', 'we turn under that third bush and so down into the valley .', 'and he set off ahead at a swinging walk .', 'then he stopped suddenly  for he realized that the other was not following .', 'evan macian was leaning on his sword with a lowering face  like a man suddenly smitten still with doubt .', ' what on earth is the matter ', 'asked turnbull  staring in some anger .', 'evan made no reply .', ' what the deuce is the matter with you ', 'demanded the leader  again  his face slowly growing as red as his beard  then he said  suddenly  and in a more human voice   are you in pain  macian ', ' yes  replied the highlander  without lifting his face .', ' take some brandy  cried turnbull  walking forward hurriedly towards him .', ' you  ve got it .', ' it  s not in the body  said macian  in his dull  strange way .', ' the pain has come into my mind .', 'a very dreadful thing has just come into my thoughts .', ' what the devil are you talking about ', 'asked turnbull .', 'macian broke out with a queer and living voice .', ' we must fight now  turnbull .', 'we must fight now .', 'a frightful thing has come upon me  and i know it must be now and here .', 'i must kill you here  he cried  with a sort of tearful rage impossible to describe .', ' here  here  upon this blessed grass .', ' why  you idiot  began turnbull .', ' the hour has come  the black hour god meant for it .', 'quick  it will soon be gone .', 'quick ', 'and he flung the scabbard from him furiously  and stood with the sunlight sparkling along his sword .', ' you confounded fool  repeated turnbull .', ' put that thing up again  you ass  people will come out of that house at the first clash of the steel .', ' one of us will be dead before they come  said the other  hoarsely   for this is the hour god meant .', ' well  i never thought much of god  said the editor of the atheist  losing all patience .', ' and i think less now .', 'never mind what god meant .', 'kindly enlighten my pagan darkness as to what the devil you mean .', ' the hour will soon be gone .', 'in a moment it will be gone  said the madman .', ' it is now  now  now that i must nail your blaspheming body to the earth  now  now that i must avenge our lady on her vile slanderer .', 'now or never .', 'for the dreadful thought is in my mind .', ' and what thought  asked turnbull  with frantic composure   occupies what you call your mind ', ' i must kill you now  said the fanatic   because ', ' well  because  said turnbull  patiently .', ' because i have begun to like you .', 'turnbull  s face had a sudden spasm in the sunlight  a change so instantaneous that it left no trace behind it  and his features seemed still carved into a cold stare .', 'but when he spoke again he seemed like a man who was placidly pretending to misunderstand something that he understood perfectly well .', ' your affection expresses itself in an abrupt form  he began  but macian broke the brittle and frivolous speech to pieces with a violent voice .', ' do not trouble to talk like that  he said .', ' you know what i mean as well as i know it .', 'come on and fight  i say .', 'perhaps you are feeling just as i do .', 'turnbull  s face flinched again in the fierce sunlight  but his attitude kept its contemptuous ease .', ' your celtic mind really goes too fast for me  he said   let me be permitted in my heavy lowland way to understand this new development .', 'my dear mr . macian  what do you really mean ', 'macian still kept the shining sword  point towards the other  s breast .', ' you know what i mean .', 'you mean the same yourself .', 'we must fight now or else ', ' or else ', 'repeated turnbull  staring at him with an almost blinding gravity .', ' or else we may not want to fight at all  answered evan  and the end of his speech was like a despairing cry .', 'turnbull took out his own sword suddenly as if to engage  then planting it point downwards for a moment  he said   before we begin  may i ask you a question ', 'macian bowed patiently  but with burning eyes .', ' you said  just now  continued turnbull  presently   that if we did not fight now  we might not want to fight at all .', 'how would you feel about the matter if we came not to want to fight at all ', ' i should feel  answered the other   just as i should feel if you had drawn your sword  and i had run away from it .', 'i should feel that because i had been weak  justice had not been done .', ' justice  answered turnbull  with a thoughtful smile   but we are talking about your feelings .', 'and what do you mean by justice  apart from your feelings ', 'macian made a gesture of weary recognition ', ' oh  nominalism  he said  with a sort of sigh   we had all that out in the twelfth century .', ' i wish we could have it out now  replied the other  firmly .', ' do you really mean that if you came to think me right  you would be certainly wrong ', ' if i had a blow on the back of my head  i might come to think you a green elephant  answered macian   but have i not the right to say now  that if i thought that i should think wrong ', ' then you are quite certain that it would be wrong to like me ', 'asked turnbull  with a slight smile .', ' no  said evan  thoughtfully   i do not say that .', 'it may not be the devil  it may be some part of god i am not meant to know .', 'but i had a work to do  and it is making the work difficult .', ' and i suppose  said the atheist  quite gently   that you and i know all about which part of god we ought to know .', 'macian burst out like a man driven back and explaining everything .', ' the church is not a thing like the athenaeum club  he cried .', ' if the athenaeum club lost all its members  the athenaeum club would dissolve and cease to exist .', 'but when we belong to the church we belong to something which is outside all of us  which is outside everything you talk about  outside the cardinals and the pope .', 'they belong to it  but it does not belong to them .', 'if we all fell dead suddenly  the church would still somehow exist in god .', 'confound it all  don  t you see that i am more sure of its existence than i am of my own existence ', 'and yet you ask me to trust my temperament  my own temperament  which can be turned upside down by two bottles of claret or an attack of the jaundice .', 'you ask me to trust that when it softens towards you and not to trust the thing which i believe to be outside myself and more real than the blood in my body .', ' stop a moment  said turnbull  in the same easy tone   even in the very act of saying that you believe this or that  you imply that there is a part of yourself that you trust even if there are many parts which you mistrust .', 'if it is only you that like me  surely  also  it is only you that believe in the catholic church .', 'evan remained in an unmoved and grave attitude .', ' there is a part of me which is divine  he answered   a part that can be trusted  but there are also affections which are entirely animal and idle .', ' and you are quite certain  i suppose  continued turnbull   that if even you esteem me the esteem would be wholly animal and idle ', 'for the first time macian started as if he had not expected the thing that was said to him .', 'at last he said ', ' whatever in earth or heaven it is that has joined us two together  it seems to be something which makes it impossible to lie .', 'no  i do not think that the movement in me towards you was ... was that surface sort of thing .', 'it may have been something deeper ... something strange .', 'i cannot understand the thing at all .', 'but understand this and understand it thoroughly  if i loved you my love might be divine .', 'no  it is not some trifle that we are fighting about .', 'it is not some superstition or some symbol .', 'when you wrote those words about our lady  you were in that act a wicked man doing a wicked thing .', 'if i hate you it is because you have hated goodness .', 'and if i like you ... it is because you are good .', 'turnbull  s face wore an indecipherable expression .', ' well  shall we fight now ', 'he said .', ' yes  said macian  with a sudden contraction of his black brows   yes  it must be now .', 'the bright swords crossed  and the first touch of them  travelling down blade and arm  told each combatant that the heart of the other was awakened .', 'it was not in that way that the swords rang together when they had rushed on each other in the little garden behind the dealer  s shop .', 'there was a pause  and then macian made a movement as if to thrust  and almost at the same moment turnbull suddenly and calmly dropped his sword .', 'evan stared round in an unusual bewilderment  and then realized that a large man in pale clothes and a panama hat was strolling serenely towards them .', 'v . the peacemaker', 'when the combatants  with crossed swords  became suddenly conscious of a third party  they each made the same movement .', 'it was as quick as the snap of a pistol  and they altered it instantaneously and recovered their original pose  but they had both made it  they had both seen it  and they both knew what it was .', 'it was not a movement of anger at being interrupted .', 'say or think what they would  it was a movement of relief .', 'a force within them  and yet quite beyond them  seemed slowly and pitilessly washing away the adamant of their oath .', 'as mistaken lovers might watch the inevitable sunset of first love  these men watched the sunset of their first hatred .', 'their hearts were growing weaker and weaker against each other .', 'when their weapons rang and riposted in the little london garden  they could have been very certain that if a third party had interrupted them something at least would have happened .', 'they would have killed each other or they would have killed him .', 'but now nothing could undo or deny that flash of fact  that for a second they had been glad to be interrupted .', 'some new and strange thing was rising higher and higher in their hearts like a high sea at night .', 'it was something that seemed all the more merciless  because it might turn out an enormous mercy .', 'was there  perhaps  some such fatalism in friendship as all lovers talk about in love ', 'did god make men love each other against their will ', ' i  m sure you  ll excuse my speaking to you  said the stranger  in a voice at once eager and deprecating .', 'the voice was too polite for good manners .', 'it was incongruous with the eccentric spectacle of the duellists which ought to have startled a sane and free man .', 'it was also incongruous with the full and healthy  though rather loose physique of the man who spoke .', 'at the first glance he looked a fine animal  with curling gold beard and hair  and blue eyes  unusually bright .', 'it was only at the second glance that the mind felt a sudden and perhaps unmeaning irritation at the way in which the gold beard retreated backwards into the waistcoat  and the way in which the finely shaped nose went forward as if smelling its way .', 'and it was only  perhaps  at the hundredth glance that the bright blue eyes  which normally before and after the instant seemed brilliant with intelligence  seemed as it were to be brilliant with idiocy .', 'he was a heavy  healthy  looking man  who looked all the larger because of the loose  light coloured clothes that he wore  and that had in their extreme lightness and looseness  almost a touch of the tropics .', 'but a closer examination of his attire would have shown that even in the tropics it would have been unique  but it was all woven according to some hygienic texture which no human being had ever heard of before  and which was absolutely necessary even for a day  s health .', 'he wore a huge broad  brimmed hat  equally hygienic  very much at the back of his head  and his voice coming out of so heavy and hearty a type of man was  as i have said  startlingly shrill and deferential .', ' i  m sure you  ll excuse my speaking to you  he said .', ' now  i wonder if you are in some little difficulty which  after all  we could settle very comfortably together ', 'now  you don  t mind my saying this  do you ', 'the face of both combatants remained somewhat solid under this appeal .', 'but the stranger  probably taking their silence for a gathering shame  continued with a kind of gaiety ', ' so you are the young men i have read about in the papers .', 'well  of course  when one is young  one is rather romantic .', 'do you know what i always say to young people ', 'a blank silence followed this gay inquiry .', 'then turnbull said in a colourless voice ', ' as i was forty  seven last birthday  i probably came into the world too soon for the experience .', ' very good  very good  said the friendly person .', ' dry scotch humour .', 'dry scotch humour .', 'well now .', 'i understand that you two people want to fight a duel .', 'i suppose you aren  t much up in the modern world .', 'we  ve quite outgrown duelling  you know .', 'in fact  tolstoy tells us that we shall soon outgrow war  which he says is simply a duel between nations .', 'a duel between nations .', 'but there is no doubt about our having outgrown duelling .', 'waiting for some effect upon his wooden auditors  the stranger stood beaming for a moment and then resumed ', ' now  they tell me in the newspapers that you are really wanting to fight about something connected with roman catholicism .', 'now  do you know what i always say to roman catholics ', ' no  said turnbull  heavily .', ' do they ', 'it seemed to be a characteristic of the hearty  hygienic gentleman that he always forgot the speech he had made the moment before .', 'without enlarging further on the fixed form of his appeal to the church of rome  he laughed cordially at turnbull  s answer  then his wandering blue eyes caught the sunlight on the swords  and he assumed a good  humoured gravity .', ' but you know this is a serious matter  he said  eyeing turnbull and macian  as if they had just been keeping the table in a roar with their frivolities .', ' i am sure that if i appealed to your higher natures ... your higher natures .', 'every man has a higher nature and a lower nature .', 'now  let us put the matter very plainly  and without any romantic nonsense about honour or anything of that sort .', 'is not bloodshed a great sin ', ' no  said macian  speaking for the first time .', ' well  really  really ', 'said the peacemaker .', ' murder is a sin  said the immovable highlander .', ' there is no sin of bloodshed .', ' well  we won  t quarrel about a word  said the other  pleasantly .', ' why on earth not ', 'said macian  with a sudden asperity .', ' why shouldn  t we quarrel about a word ', 'what is the good of words if they aren  t important enough to quarrel over ', 'why do we choose one word more than another if there isn  t any difference between them ', 'if you called a woman a chimpanzee instead of an angel  wouldn  t there be a quarrel about a word ', 'if you  re not going to argue about words  what are you going to argue about ', 'are you going to convey your meaning to me by moving your ears ', 'the church and the heresies always used to fight about words  because they are the only things worth fighting about .', 'i say that murder is a sin  and bloodshed is not  and that there is as much difference between those words as there is between the word  yes  and the word  no  or rather more difference  for  yes  and  no  at least  belong to the same category .', 'murder is a spiritual incident .', 'bloodshed is a physical incident .', 'a surgeon commits bloodshed .', ' ah  you  re a casuist ', 'said the large man  wagging his head .', ' now  do you know what i always say to casuists ...', 'macian made a violent gesture  and turnbull broke into open laughter .', 'the peacemaker did not seem to be in the least annoyed  but continued in unabated enjoyment .', ' well  well  he said   let us get back to the point .', 'now tolstoy has shown that force is no remedy  so you see the position in which i am placed .', 'i am doing my best to stop what i  m sure you won  t mind my calling this really useless violence  this really quite wrong violence of yours .', 'but it  s against my principles to call in the police against you  because the police are still on a lower moral plane  so to speak  because  in short  the police undoubtedly sometimes employ force .', 'tolstoy has shown that violence merely breeds violence in the person towards whom it is used  whereas love  on the other hand  breeds love .', 'so you see how i am placed .', 'i am reduced to use love in order to stop you .', 'i am obliged to use love .', 'he gave to the word an indescribable sound of something hard and heavy  as if he were saying  boots .', 'turnbull suddenly gripped his sword and said  shortly   i see how you are placed quite well  sir .', 'you will not call the police .', 'mr . macian  shall we engage ', 'macian plucked his sword out of the grass .', ' i must and will stop this shocking crime  cried the tolstoian  crimson in the face .', ' it is against all modern ideas .', 'it is against the principle of love .', 'how you  sir  who pretend to be a christian ...', 'macian turned upon him with a white face and bitter lip .', ' sir  he said   talk about the principle of love as much as you like .', 'you seem to me colder than a lump of stone  but i am willing to believe that you may at some time have loved a cat  or a dog  or a child .', 'when you were a baby  i suppose you loved your mother .', 'talk about love  then  till the world is sick of the word .', 'but don  t you talk about christianity .', 'don  t you dare to say one word  white or black  about it .', 'christianity is  as far as you are concerned  a horrible mystery .', 'keep clear of it  keep silent upon it  as you would upon an abomination .', 'it is a thing that has made men slay and torture each other  and you will never know why .', 'it is a thing that has made men do evil that good might come  and you will never understand the evil  let alone the good .', 'christianity is a thing that could only make you vomit  till you are other than you are .', 'i would not justify it to you even if i could .', 'hate it  in god  s name  as turnbull does  who is a man .', 'it is a monstrous thing  for which men die .', 'and if you will stand here and talk about love for another ten minutes it is very probable that you will see a man die for it .', 'and he fell on guard .', 'turnbull was busy settling something loose in his elaborate hilt  and the pause was broken by the stranger .', ' suppose i call the police ', 'he said  with a heated face .', ' and deny your most sacred dogma  said macian .', ' dogma ', 'cried the man  in a sort of dismay .', ' oh  we have no dogmas  you know ', 'there was another silence  and he said again  airily ', ' you know  i think  there  s something in what shaw teaches about no moral principles being quite fixed .', 'have you ever read the quintessence of ibsenism ', 'of course he went very wrong over the war .', 'turnbull  with a bent  flushed face  was tying up the loose piece of the pommel with string .', 'with the string in his teeth  he said   oh  make up your damned mind and clear out ', ' it  s a serious thing  said the philosopher  shaking his head .', ' i must be alone and consider which is the higher point of view .', 'i rather feel that in a case so extreme as this ... and he went slowly away .', 'as he disappeared among the trees  they heard him murmuring in a sing  song voice   new occasions teach new duties  out of a poem by james russell lowell .', ' ah  said macian  drawing a deep breath .', ' don  t you believe in prayer now ', 'i prayed for an angel .', ' an hour ago  said the highlander  in his heavy meditative voice   i felt the devil weakening my heart and my oath against you  and i prayed that god would send an angel to my aid .', ' well ', 'inquired the other  finishing his mending and wrapping the rest of the string round his hand to get a firmer grip .', ' well ', ' well  that man was an angel  said macian .', ' i didn  t know they were as bad as that  answered turnbull .', ' we know that devils sometimes quote scripture and counterfeit good  replied the mystic .', ' why should not angels sometimes come to show us the black abyss of evil on whose brink we stand .', 'if that man had not tried to stop us ... i might ... i might have stopped .', ' i know what you mean  said turnbull  grimly .', ' but then he came  broke out macian   and my soul said to me   give up fighting  and you will become like that .', 'give up vows and dogmas  and fixed things  and you may grow like that .', 'you may learn  also  that fog of false philosophy .', 'you may grow fond of that mire of crawling  cowardly morals  and you may come to think a blow bad  because it hurts  and not because it humiliates .', 'you may come to think murder wrong  because it is violent  and not because it is unjust .', 'oh  you blasphemer of the good  an hour ago i almost loved you ', 'but do not fear for me now .', 'i have heard the word love pronounced in his intonation  and i know exactly what it means .', 'on guard ', 'the swords caught on each other with a dreadful clang and jar  full of the old energy and hate  and at once plunged and replunged .', 'once more each man  s heart had become the magnet of a mad sword .', 'suddenly  furious as they were  they were frozen for a moment motionless .', ' what noise is that ', 'asked the highlander  hoarsely .', ' i think i know  replied turnbull .', ' what ...', 'what ', 'cried the other .', ' the student of shaw and tolstoy has made up his remarkable mind  said turnbull  quietly .', ' the police are coming up the hill .', 'vi .', 'the other philosopher', 'between high hedges in hertfordshire  hedges so high as to create a kind of grove  two men were running .', 'they did not run in a scampering or feverish manner  but in the steady swing of the pendulum .', 'across the great plains and uplands to the right and left of the lane  a long tide of sunset light rolled like a sea of ruby  lighting up the long terraces of the hills and picking out the few windows of the scattered hamlets in startling blood  red sparks .', 'but the lane was cut deep in the hill and remained in an abrupt shadow .', 'the two men running in it had an impression not uncommonly experienced between those wild green english walls  a sense of being led between the walls of a maze .', 'though their pace was steady it was vigorous  their faces were heated and their eyes fixed and bright .', 'there was  indeed  something a little mad in the contrast between the evening  s stillness over the empty country  side  and these two figures fleeing wildly from nothing .', 'they had the look of two lunatics  possibly they were .', ' are you all right ', 'said turnbull  with civility .', ' can you keep this up ', ' quite easily  thank you  replied macian .', ' i run very well .', ' is that a qualification in a family of warriors ', 'asked turnbull .', ' undoubtedly .', 'rapid movement is essential  answered macian  who never saw a joke in his life .', 'turnbull broke out into a short laugh  and silence fell between them  the panting silence of runners .', 'then macian said   we run better than any of those policemen .', 'they are too fat .', 'why do you make your policemen so fat ', ' i didn  t do much towards making them fat myself  replied turnbull  genially   but i flatter myself that i am now doing something towards making them thin .', 'you  ll see they will be as lean as rakes by the time they catch us .', 'they will look like your friend  cardinal manning .', ' but they won  t catch us  said macian  in his literal way .', ' no  we beat them in the great military art of running away  returned the other .', ' they won  t catch us unless ', 'macian turned his long equine face inquiringly .', ' unless what ', 'he said  for turnbull had gone silent suddenly  and seemed to be listening intently as he ran as a horse does with his ears turned back .', ' unless what ', 'repeated the highlander .', ' unless they do  what they have done .', 'listen .', 'macian slackened his trot  and turned his head to the trail they had left behind them .', 'across two or three billows of the up and down lane came along the ground the unmistakable throbbing of horses  hoofs .', ' they have put the mounted police on us  said turnbull  shortly .', ' good lord  one would think we were a revolution .', ' so we are  said macian calmly .', ' what shall we do ', 'shall we turn on them with our points ', ' it may come to that  answered turnbull   though if it does  i reckon that will be the last act .', 'we must put it off if we can .', 'and he stared and peered about him between the bushes .', ' if we could hide somewhere the beasts might go by us  he said .', ' the police have their faults  but thank god they  re inefficient .', 'why  here  s the very thing .', 'be quick and quiet .', 'follow me .', 'he suddenly swung himself up the high bank on one side of the lane .', 'it was almost as high and smooth as a wall  and on the top of it the black hedge stood out over them as an angle  almost like a thatched roof of the lane .', 'and the burning evening sky looked down at them through the tangle with red eyes as of an army of goblins .', 'turnbull hoisted himself up and broke the hedge with his body .', 'as his head and shoulders rose above it they turned to flame in the full glow as if lit up by an immense firelight .', 'his red hair and beard looked almost scarlet  and his pale face as bright as a boy  s .', 'something violent  something that was at once love and hatred  surged in the strange heart of the gael below him .', 'he had an unutterable sense of epic importance  as if he were somehow lifting all humanity into a prouder and more passionate region of the air .', 'as he swung himself up also into the evening light he felt as if he were rising on enormous wings .', 'legends of the morning of the world which he had heard in childhood or read in youth came back upon him in a cloudy splendour  purple tales of wrath and friendship  like roland and oliver  or balin and balan  reminding him of emotional entanglements .', 'men who had loved each other and then fought each other  men who had fought each other and then loved each other  together made a mixed but monstrous sense of momentousness .', 'the crimson seas of the sunset seemed to him like a bursting out of some sacred blood  as if the heart of the world had broken .', 'turnbull was wholly unaffected by any written or spoken poetry  his was a powerful and prosaic mind .', 'but even upon him there came for the moment something out of the earth and the passionate ends of the sky .', 'the only evidence was in his voice  which was still practical but a shade more quiet .', ' do you see that summer  house  looking thing over there ', 'he asked shortly .', ' that will do for us very well .', 'keeping himself free from the tangle of the hedge he strolled across a triangle of obscure kitchen garden  and approached a dismal shed or lodge a yard or two beyond it .', 'it was a weather  stained hut of grey wood  which with all its desolation retained a tag or two of trivial ornament  which suggested that the thing had once been a sort of summer  house  and the place probably a sort of garden .', ' that is quite invisible from the road  said turnbull  as he entered it   and it will cover us up for the night .', 'macian looked at him gravely for a few moments .', ' sir  he said   i ought to say something to you .', 'i ought to say ', ' hush  said turnbull  suddenly lifting his hand   be still  man .', 'in the sudden silence  the drumming of the distant horses grew louder and louder with inconceivable rapidity  and the cavalcade of police rushed by below them in the lane  almost with the roar and rattle of an express train .', ' i ought to tell you  continued macian  still staring stolidly at the other   that you are a great chief  and it is good to go to war behind you .', 'turnbull said nothing  but turned and looked out of the foolish lattice of the little windows  then he said   we must have food and sleep first .', 'when the last echo of their eluded pursuers had died in the distant uplands  turnbull began to unpack the provisions with the easy air of a man at a picnic .', 'he had just laid out the last items  put a bottle of wine on the floor  and a tin of salmon on the window  ledge  when the bottomless silence of that forgotten place was broken .', 'and it was broken by three heavy blows of a stick delivered upon the door .', 'turnbull looked up in the act of opening a tin and stared silently at his companion .', 'macian  s long  lean mouth had shut hard .', ' who the devil can that be ', 'said turnbull .', ' god knows  said the other .', ' it might be god .', 'again the sound of the wooden stick reverberated on the wooden door .', 'it was a curious sound and on consideration did not resemble the ordinary effects of knocking on a door for admittance .', 'it was rather as if the point of a stick were plunged again and again at the panels in an absurd attempt to make a hole in them .', 'a wild look sprang into macian  s eyes and he got up half stupidly  with a kind of stagger  put his hand out and caught one of the swords .', ' let us fight at once  he cried   it is the end of the world .', ' you  re overdone  macian  said turnbull  putting him on one side .', ' it  s only someone playing the goat .', 'let me open the door .', 'but he also picked up a sword as he stepped to open it .', 'he paused one moment with his hand on the handle and then flung the door open .', 'almost as he did so the ferrule of an ordinary bamboo cane came at his eyes  so that he had actually to parry it with the naked weapon in his hands .', 'as the two touched  the point of the stick was dropped very abruptly  and the man with the stick stepped hurriedly back .', 'against the heraldic background of sprawling crimson and gold offered him by the expiring sunset  the figure of the man with the stick showed at first merely black and fantastic .', 'he was a small man with two wisps of long hair that curled up on each side  and seen in silhouette  looked like horns .', 'he had a bow tie so big that the two ends showed on each side of his neck like unnatural stunted wings .', 'he had his long black cane still tilted in his hand like a fencing foil and half presented at the open door .', 'his large straw hat had fallen behind him as he leapt backwards .', ' with reference to your suggestion  macian  said turnbull  placidly   i think it looks more like the devil .', ' who on earth are you ', 'cried the stranger in a high shrill voice  brandishing his cane defensively .', ' let me see  said turnbull  looking round to macian with the same blandness .', ' who are we ', ' come out  screamed the little man with the stick .', ' certainly  said turnbull  and went outside with the sword  macian following .', 'seen more fully  with the evening light on his face  the strange man looked a little less like a goblin .', 'he wore a square pale  grey jacket suit  on which the grey butterfly tie was the only indisputable touch of affectation .', 'against the great sunset his figure had looked merely small  seen in a more equal light it looked tolerably compact and shapely .', 'his reddish  brown hair  combed into two great curls  looked like the long  slow curling hair of the women in some pre  raphaelite pictures .', 'but within this feminine frame of hair his face was unexpectedly impudent  like a monkey  s .', ' what are you doing here ', 'he said  in a sharp small voice .', ' well  said macian  in his grave childish way   what are you doing here ', ' i  said the man  indignantly   i  m in my own garden .', ' oh  said macian  simply   i apologize .', 'turnbull was coolly curling his red moustache  and the stranger stared from one to the other  temporarily stunned by their innocent assurance .', ' but  may i ask  he said at last   what the devil you are doing in my summer  house ', ' certainly  said macian .', ' we were just going to fight .', ' to fight ', 'repeated the man .', ' we had better tell this gentleman the whole business  broke in turnbull .', 'then turning to the stranger he said firmly   i am sorry  sir  but we have something to do that must be done .', 'and i may as well tell you at the beginning and to avoid waste of time or language  that we cannot admit any interference .', ' we were just going to take some slight refreshment when you interrupted us ...', 'the little man had a dawning expression of understanding and stooped and picked up the unused bottle of wine  eyeing it curiously .', 'turnbull continued ', ' but that refreshment was preparatory to something which i fear you will find less comprehensible  but on which our minds are entirely fixed  sir .', 'we are forced to fight a duel .', 'we are forced by honour and an internal intellectual need .', 'do not  for your own sake  attempt to stop us .', 'i know all the excellent and ethical things that you will want to say to us .', 'i know all about the essential requirements of civil order  i have written leading articles about them all my life .', 'i know all about the sacredness of human life  i have bored all my friends with it .', 'try and understand our position .', 'this man and i are alone in the modern world in that we think that god is essentially important .', 'i think he does not exist  that is where the importance comes in for me .', 'but this man thinks that he does exist  and thinking that very properly thinks him more important than anything else .', 'now we wish to make a great demonstration and assertion  something that will set the world on fire like the first christian persecutions .', 'if you like  we are attempting a mutual martyrdom .', 'the papers have posted up every town against us .', 'scotland yard has fortified every police station with our enemies  we are driven therefore to the edge of a lonely lane  and indirectly to taking liberties with your summer  house in order to arrange our ...', ' stop ', 'roared the little man in the butterfly necktie .', ' put me out of my intellectual misery .', 'are you really the two tomfools i have read of in all the papers ', 'are you the two people who wanted to spit each other in the police court ', 'are you ', 'are you ', ' yes  said macian   it began in a police court .', 'the little man slung the bottle of wine twenty yards away like a stone .', ' come up to my place  he said .', ' i  ve got better stuff than that .', 'i  ve got the best beaune within fifty miles of here .', 'come up .', 'you  re the very men i wanted to see .', 'even turnbull  with his typical invulnerability  was a little taken aback by this boisterous and almost brutal hospitality .', ' why ... sir ... he began .', ' come up ', 'come in ', 'howled the little man  dancing with delight .', ' i  ll give you a dinner .', 'i  ll give you a bed ', 'i  ll give you a green smooth lawn and your choice of swords and pistols .', 'why  you fools  i adore fighting ', 'it  s the only good thing in god  s world ', 'i  ve walked about these damned fields and longed to see somebody cut up and killed and the blood running .', 'ha ', 'ha ', 'and he made sudden lunges with his stick at the trunk of a neighbouring tree so that the ferrule made fierce prints and punctures in the bark .', ' excuse me  said macian suddenly with the wide  eyed curiosity of a child   excuse me  but ...', ' well ', 'said the small fighter  brandishing his wooden weapon .', ' excuse me  repeated macian   but was that what you were doing at the door ', 'the little man stared an instant and then said   yes  and turnbull broke into a guffaw .', ' come on ', 'cried the little man  tucking his stick under his arm and taking quite suddenly to his heels .', ' come on ', 'confound me  i  ll see both of you eat and then i  ll see one of you die .', 'lord bless me  the gods must exist after all  they have sent me one of my day  dreams ', 'lord ', 'a duel ', 'he had gone flying along a winding path between the borders of the kitchen garden  and in the increasing twilight he was as hard to follow as a flying hare .', 'but at length the path after many twists betrayed its purpose and led abruptly up two or three steps to the door of a tiny but very clean cottage .', 'there was nothing about the outside to distinguish it from other cottages  except indeed its ominous cleanliness and one thing that was out of all the custom and tradition of all cottages under the sun .', 'in the middle of the little garden among the stocks and marigolds there surged up in shapeless stone a south sea island idol .', 'there was something gross and even evil in that eyeless and alien god among the most innocent of the english flowers .', ' come in ', 'cried the creature again .', ' come in ', 'it  s better inside ', 'whether or no it was better inside it was at least a surprise .', 'the moment the two duellists had pushed open the door of that inoffensive  whitewashed cottage they found that its interior was lined with fiery gold .', 'it was like stepping into a chamber in the arabian nights .', 'the door that closed behind them shut out england and all the energies of the west .', 'the ornaments that shone and shimmered on every side of them were subtly mixed from many periods and lands  but were all oriental .', 'cruel assyrian bas  reliefs ran along the sides of the passage  cruel turkish swords and daggers glinted above and below them  the two were separated by ages and fallen civilizations .', 'yet they seemed to sympathize since they were both harmonious and both merciless .', 'the house seemed to consist of chamber within chamber and created that impression as of a dream which belongs also to the arabian nights themselves .', 'the innermost room of all was like the inside of a jewel .', 'the little man who owned it all threw himself on a heap of scarlet and golden cushions and struck his hands together .', 'a negro in a white robe and turban appeared suddenly and silently behind them .', ' selim  said the host   these two gentlemen are staying with me tonight .', 'send up the very best wine and dinner at once .', 'and selim  one of these gentlemen will probably die tomorrow .', 'make arrangements  please .', 'the negro bowed and withdrew .', 'evan macian came out the next morning into the little garden to a fresh silver day  his long face looking more austere than ever in that cold light  his eyelids a little heavy .', 'he carried one of the swords .', 'turnbull was in the little house behind him  demolishing the end of an early breakfast and humming a tune to himself  which could be heard through the open window .', 'a moment or two later he leapt to his feet and came out into the sunlight  still munching toast  his own sword stuck under his arm like a walking  stick .', 'their eccentric host had vanished from sight  with a polite gesture  some twenty minutes before .', 'they imagined him to be occupied on some concerns in the interior of the house  and they waited for his emergence  stamping the garden in silence  the garden of tall  fresh country flowers  in the midst of which the monstrous south sea idol lifted itself as abruptly as the prow of a ship riding on a sea of red and white and gold .', 'it was with a start  therefore  that they came upon the man himself already in the garden .', 'they were all the more startled because of the still posture in which they found him .', 'he was on his knees in front of the stone idol  rigid and motionless  like a saint in a trance or ecstasy .', 'yet when turnbull  s tread broke a twig  he was on his feet in a flash .', ' excuse me  he said with an irradiation of smiles  but yet with a kind of bewilderment .', ' so sorry ... family prayers ... old fashioned ... mother  s knee .', 'let us go on to the lawn behind .', 'and he ducked rapidly round the statue to an open space of grass on the other side of it .', ' this will do us best  mr . macian  said he .', 'then he made a gesture towards the heavy stone figure on the pedestal which had now its blank and shapeless back turned towards them .', ' don  t you be afraid  he added   he can still see us .', 'macian turned his blue  blinking eyes  which seemed still misty with sleep  or sleeplessness  towards the idol  but his brows drew together .', 'the little man with the long hair also had his eyes on the back view of the god .', 'his eyes were at once liquid and burning  and he rubbed his hands slowly against each other .', ' do you know  he said   i think he can see us better this way .', 'i often think that this blank thing is his real face  watching  though it cannot be watched .', 'he ', 'he ', 'yes  i think he looks nice from behind .', 'he looks more cruel from behind  don  t you think ', ' what the devil is the thing ', 'asked turnbull gruffly .', ' it is the only thing there is  answered the other .', ' it is force .', ' oh ', 'said turnbull shortly .', ' yes  my friends  said the little man  with an animated countenance  fluttering his fingers in the air   it was no chance that led you to this garden  surely it was the caprice of some old god  some happy  pitiless god .', 'perhaps it was his will  for he loves blood  and on that stone in front of him men have been butchered by hundreds in the fierce  feasting islands of the south .', 'in this cursed  craven place i have not been permitted to kill men on his altar .', 'only rabbits and cats  sometimes .', 'in the stillness macian made a sudden movement  unmeaning apparently  and then remained rigid .', ' but today  today  continued the small man in a shrill voice .', ' today his hour is come .', 'today his will is done on earth as it is in heaven .', 'men  men  men will bleed before him today .', 'and he bit his forefinger in a kind of fever .', 'still  the two duellists stood with their swords as heavily as statues  and the silence seemed to cool the eccentric and call him back to more rational speech .', ' perhaps i express myself a little too lyrically  he said with an amicable abruptness .', ' my philosophy has its higher ecstasies  but perhaps you are hardly worked up to them yet .', 'let us confine ourselves to the unquestioned .', 'you have found your way  gentlemen  by a beautiful accident  to the house of the only man in england  probably  who will favour and encourage your most reasonable project .', 'from cornwall to cape wrath this county is one horrible  solid block of humanitarianism .', 'you will find men who will defend this or that war in a distant continent .', 'they will defend it on the contemptible ground of commerce or the more contemptible ground of social good .', 'but do not fancy that you will find one other person who will comprehend a strong man taking the sword in his hand and wiping out his enemy .', 'my name is wimpey  morrice wimpey .', 'i had a fellowship at magdalen .', 'but i assure you i had to drop it  owing to my having said something in a public lecture infringing the popular prejudice against those great gentlemen  the assassins of the italian renaissance .', 'they let me say it at dinner and so on  and seemed to like it .', 'but in a public lecture ... so inconsistent .', 'well  as i say  here is your only refuge and temple of honour .', 'here you can fall back on that naked and awful arbitration which is the only thing that balances the stars  a still  continuous violence .', 'vae victis   down  down  down with the defeated ', 'victory is the only ultimate fact .', 'carthage was destroyed  the red indians are being exterminated  that is the single certainty .', 'in an hour from now that sun will still be shining and that grass growing  and one of you will be conquered  one of you will be the conqueror .', 'when it has been done  nothing will alter it .', 'heroes  i give you the hospitality fit for heroes .', 'and i salute the survivor .', 'fall on ', 'the two men took their swords .', 'then macian said steadily   mr . turnbull  lend me your sword a moment .', 'turnbull  with a questioning glance  handed him the weapon .', 'macian took the second sword in his left hand and  with a violent gesture  hurled it at the feet of little mr . wimpey .', ' fight ', 'he said in a loud  harsh voice .', ' fight me now ', 'wimpey took a step backward  and bewildered words bubbled on his lips .', ' pick up that sword and fight me  repeated macian  with brows as black as thunder .', 'the little man turned to turnbull with a gesture  demanding judgement or protection .', ' really  sir  he began   this gentleman confuses ...', ' you stinking little coward  roared turnbull  suddenly releasing his wrath .', ' fight  if you  re so fond of fighting ', 'fight  if you  re so fond of all that filthy philosophy ', 'if winning is everything  go in and win ', 'if the weak must go to the wall  go to the wall ', 'fight  you rat ', 'fight  or if you won  t fight  run ', 'and he ran at wimpey  with blazing eyes .', 'wimpey staggered back a few paces like a man struggling with his own limbs .', 'then he felt the furious scotchman coming at him like an express train  doubling his size every second  with eyes as big as windows and a sword as bright as the sun .', 'something broke inside him  and he found himself running away  tumbling over his own feet in terror  and crying out as he ran .', ' chase him ', 'shouted turnbull as macian snatched up the sword and joined in the scamper .', ' chase him over a county ', 'chase him into the sea ', 'shoo ', 'shoo ', 'shoo ', 'the little man plunged like a rabbit among the tall flowers  the two duellists after him .', 'turnbull kept at his tail with savage ecstasy  still shooing him like a cat .', 'but macian  as he ran past the south sea idol  paused an instant to spring upon its pedestal .', 'for five seconds he strained against the inert mass .', 'then it stirred  and he sent it over with a great crash among the flowers  that engulfed it altogether .', 'then he went bounding after the runaway .', 'in the energy of his alarm the ex  fellow of magdalen managed to leap the paling of his garden .', 'the two pursuers went over it after him like flying birds .', 'he fled frantically down a long lane with his two terrors on his trail till he came to a gap in the hedge and went across a steep meadow like the wind .', 'the two scotchmen  as they ran  kept up a cheery bellowing and waved their swords .', 'up three slanting meadows  down four slanting meadows on the other side  across another road  across a heath of snapping bracken  through a wood  across another road  and to the brink of a big pool  they pursued the flying philosopher .', 'but when he came to the pool his pace was so precipitate that he could not stop it  and with a kind of lurching stagger  he fell splash into the greasy water .', 'getting dripping to his feet  with the water up to his knees  the worshipper of force and victory waded disconsolately to the other side and drew himself on to the bank .', 'and turnbull sat down on the grass and went off into reverberations of laughter .', 'a second afterwards the most extraordinary grimaces were seen to distort the stiff face of macian  and unholy sounds came from within .', 'he had never practised laughing  and it hurt him very much .', 'vii .', 'the village of grassley  in  the  hole', 'at about half past one  under a strong blue sky  turnbull got up out of the grass and fern in which he had been lying  and his still intermittent laughter ended in a kind of yawn .', ' i  m hungry  he said shortly .', ' are you ', ' i have not noticed  answered macian .', ' what are you going to do ', ' there  s a village down the road  past the pool  answered turnbull .', ' i can see it from here .', 'i can see the whitewashed walls of some cottages and a kind of corner of the church .', 'how jolly it all looks .', 'it looks so  i don  t know what the word is  so sensible .', 'don  t fancy i  m under any illusions about arcadian virtue and the innocent villagers .', 'men make beasts of themselves there with drink  but they don  t deliberately make devils of themselves with mere talking .', 'they kill wild animals in the wild woods  but they don  t kill cats to the god of victory .', 'they don  t  he broke off and suddenly spat on the ground .', ' excuse me  he said   it was ceremonial .', 'one has to get the taste out of one  s mouth .', ' the taste of what ', 'asked macian .', ' i don  t know the exact name for it  replied turnbull .', ' perhaps it is the south sea islands  or it may be magdalen college .', 'there was a long pause  and macian also lifted his large limbs off the ground  his eyes particularly dreamy .', ' i know what you mean  turnbull  he said   but ... i always thought you people agreed with all that .', ' with all that about doing as one likes  and the individual  and nature loving the strongest  and all the things which that cockroach talked about .', 'turnbull  s big blue  grey eyes stood open with a grave astonishment .', ' do you really mean to say  macian  he said   that you fancied that we  the free  thinkers  that bradlaugh  or holyoake  or ingersoll  believe all that dirty  immoral mysticism about nature ', 'damn nature ', ' i supposed you did  said macian calmly .', ' it seems to me your most conclusive position .', ' and you mean to tell me  rejoined the other   that you broke my window  and challenged me to mortal combat  and tied a tradesman up with ropes  and chased an oxford fellow across five meadows  all under the impression that i am such an illiterate idiot as to believe in nature ', ' i supposed you did  repeated macian with his usual mildness   but i admit that i know little of the details of your belief  or disbelief .', 'turnbull swung round quite suddenly  and set off towards the village .', ' come along  he cried .', ' come down to the village .', 'come down to the nearest decent inhabitable pub .', 'this is a case for beer .', ' i do not quite follow you  said the highlander .', ' yes  you do  answered turnbull .', ' you follow me slap into the inn  parlour .', 'i repeat  this is a case for beer .', 'we must have the whole of this matter out thoroughly before we go a step farther .', 'do you know that an idea has just struck me of great simplicity and of some cogency .', 'do not by any means let us drop our intentions of settling our differences with two steel swords .', 'but do you not think that with two pewter pots we might do what we really have never thought of doing yet  discover what our difference is ', ' it never occurred to me before  answered macian with tranquillity .', ' it is a good suggestion .', 'and they set out at an easy swing down the steep road to the village of grassley  in  the  hole .', 'grassley  in  the  hole was a rude parallelogram of buildings  with two thoroughfares which might have been called two high streets if it had been possible to call them streets .', 'one of these ways was higher on the slope than the other  the whole parallelogram lying aslant  so to speak  on the side of the hill .', 'the upper of these two roads was decorated with a big public house  a butcher  s shop  a small public house  a sweetstuff shop  a very small public house  and an illegible signpost .', 'the lower of the two roads boasted a horse  pond  a post office  a gentleman  s garden with very high hedges  a microscopically small public house  and two cottages .', 'where all the people lived who supported all the public houses was in this  as in many other english villages  a silent and smiling mystery .', 'the church lay a little above and beyond the village  with a square grey tower dominating it decisively .', 'but even the church was scarcely so central and solemn an institution as the large public house  the valencourt arms .', 'it was named after some splendid family that had long gone bankrupt  and whose seat was occupied by a man who had invented a hygienic bootjack  but the unfathomable sentimentalism of the english people insisted in regarding the inn  the seat and the sitter in it  as alike parts of a pure and marmoreal antiquity .', 'and in the valencourt arms festivity itself had some solemnity and decorum  and beer was drunk with reverence  as it ought to be .', 'into the principal parlour of this place entered two strangers  who found themselves  as is always the case in such hostels  the object  not of fluttered curiosity or pert inquiry  but of steady  ceaseless  devouring ocular study .', 'they had long coats down to their heels  and carried under each coat something that looked like a stick .', 'one was tall and dark  the other short and red  haired .', 'they ordered a pot of ale each .', ' macian  said turnbull  lifting his tankard   the fool who wanted us to be friends made us want to go on fighting .', 'it is only natural that the fool who wanted us to fight should make us friendly .', 'macian  your health ', 'dusk was already dropping  the rustics in the tavern were already lurching and lumbering out of it by twos and threes  crying clamorous good nights to a solitary old toper that remained  before macian and turnbull had reached the really important part of their discussion .', 'macian wore an expression of sad bewilderment not uncommon with him .', ' i am to understand  then  he said   that you don  t believe in nature .', ' you may say so in a very special and emphatic sense  said turnbull .', ' i do not believe in nature  just as i do not believe in odin .', 'she is a myth .', 'it is not merely that i do not believe that nature can guide us .', 'it is that i do not believe that nature exists .', ' exists ', 'said macian in his monotonous way  settling his pewter pot on the table .', ' yes  in a real sense nature does not exist .', 'i mean that nobody can discover what the original nature of things would have been if things had not interfered with it .', 'the first blade of grass began to tear up the earth and eat it  it was interfering with nature  if there is any nature .', 'the first wild ox began to tear up the grass and eat it  he was interfering with nature  if there is any nature .', 'in the same way  continued turnbull   the human when it asserts its dominance over nature is just as natural as the thing which it destroys .', ' and in the same way  said macian almost dreamily   the superhuman  the supernatural is just as natural as the nature which it destroys .', 'turnbull took his head out of his pewter pot in some anger .', ' the supernatural  of course  he said   is quite another thing  the case of the supernatural is simple .', 'the supernatural does not exist .', ' quite so  said macian in a rather dull voice   you said the same about the natural .', 'if the natural does not exist the supernatural obviously can  t .', 'and he yawned a little over his ale .', 'turnbull turned for some reason a little red and remarked quickly   that may be jolly clever  for all i know .', 'but everyone does know that there is a division between the things that as a matter of fact do commonly happen and the things that don  t .', 'things that break the evident laws of nature ', ' which does not exist  put in macian sleepily .', 'turnbull struck the table with a sudden hand .', ' good lord in heaven ', 'he cried ', ' who does not exist  murmured macian .', ' good lord in heaven ', 'thundered turnbull  without regarding the interruption .', ' do you really mean to sit there and say that you  like anybody else  would not recognize the difference between a natural occurrence and a supernatural one  if there could be such a thing ', 'if i flew up to the ceiling ', ' you would bump your head badly  cried macian  suddenly starting up .', ' one can  t talk of this kind of thing under a ceiling at all .', 'come outside ', 'come outside and ascend into heaven ', 'he burst the door open on a blue abyss of evening and they stepped out into it  it was suddenly and strangely cool .', ' turnbull  said macian   you have said some things so true and some so false that i want to talk  and i will try to talk so that you understand .', 'for at present you do not understand at all .', 'we don  t seem to mean the same things by the same words .', 'he stood silent for a second or two and then resumed .', ' a minute or two ago i caught you out in a real contradiction .', 'at that moment logically i was right .', 'and at that moment i knew i was wrong .', 'yes  there is a real difference between the natural and the supernatural  if you flew up into that blue sky this instant  i should think that you were moved by god  or the devil .', 'but if you want to know what i really think ... i must explain .', 'he stopped again  abstractedly boring the point of his sword into the earth  and went on ', ' i was born and bred and taught in a complete universe .', 'the supernatural was not natural  but it was perfectly reasonable .', 'nay  the supernatural to me is more reasonable than the natural  for the supernatural is a direct message from god  who is reason .', 'i was taught that some things are natural and some things divine .', 'i mean that some things are mechanical and some things divine .', 'but there is the great difficulty  turnbull .', 'the great difficulty is that  according to my teaching  you are divine .', ' me ', 'divine ', 'said turnbull truculently .', ' what do you mean ', ' that is just the difficulty  continued macian thoughtfully .', ' i was told that there was a difference between the grass and a man  s will  and the difference was that a man  s will was special and divine .', 'a man  s free will  i heard  was supernatural .', ' rubbish ', 'said turnbull .', ' oh  said macian patiently   then if a man  s free will isn  t supernatural  why do your materialists deny that it exists ', 'turnbull was silent for a moment .', 'then he began to speak  but macian continued with the same steady voice and sad eyes ', ' so what i feel is this  here is the great divine creation i was taught to believe in .', 'i can understand your disbelieving in it  but why disbelieve in a part of it ', 'it was all one thing to me .', 'god had authority because he was god .', 'man had authority because he was man .', 'you cannot prove that god is better than a man  nor can you prove that a man is better than a horse .', 'why permit any ordinary thing ', 'why do you let a horse be saddled ', ' some modern thinkers disapprove of it  said turnbull a little doubtfully .', ' i know  said macian grimly   that man who talked about love  for instance .', 'turnbull made a humorous grimace  then he said   we seem to be talking in a kind of shorthand  but i won  t pretend not to understand you .', 'what you mean is this  that you learnt about all your saints and angels at the same time as you learnt about common morality  from the same people  in the same way .', 'and you mean to say that if one may be disputed  so may the other .', 'well  let that pass for the moment .', 'but let me ask you a question in turn .', 'did not this system of yours  which you swallowed whole  contain all sorts of things that were merely local  the respect for the chief of your clan  or such things  the village ghost  the family feud  or what not ', 'did you not take in those things  too  along with your theology ', 'macian stared along the dim village road  down which the last straggler from the inn was trailing his way .', ' what you say is not unreasonable  he said .', ' but it is not quite true .', 'the distinction between the chief and us did exist  but it was never anything like the distinction between the human and the divine  or the human and the animal .', 'it was more like the distinction between one animal and another .', 'but ', ' well ', 'said turnbull .', 'macian was silent .', ' go on  repeated turnbull   what  s the matter with you ', 'what are you staring at ', ' i am staring  said macian at last   at that which shall judge us both .', ' oh  yes  said turnbull in a tired way   i suppose you mean god .', ' no  i don  t  said macian  shaking his head .', ' i mean him .', 'and he pointed to the half  tipsy yokel who was ploughing down the road .', ' what do you mean ', 'asked the atheist .', ' i mean him  repeated macian with emphasis .', ' he goes out in the early dawn  he digs or he ploughs a field .', 'then he comes back and drinks ale  and then he sings a song .', 'all your philosophies and political systems are young compared to him .', 'all your hoary cathedrals  yes  even the eternal church on earth is new compared to him .', 'the most mouldering gods in the british museum are new facts beside him .', 'it is he who in the end shall judge us all .', 'and macian rose to his feet with a vague excitement .', ' what are you going to do ', ' i am going to ask him  cried macian   which of us is right .', 'turnbull broke into a kind of laugh .', ' ask that intoxicated turnip  eater  he began .', ' yes  which of us is right  cried macian violently .', ' oh  you have long words and i have long words  and i talk of every man being the image of god  and you talk of every man being a citizen and enlightened enough to govern .', 'but if every man typifies god  there is god .', 'if every man is an enlightened citizen  there is your enlightened citizen .', 'the first man one meets is always man .', 'let us catch him up .', 'and in gigantic strides the long  lean highlander whirled away into the grey twilight  turnbull following with a good  humoured oath .', 'the track of the rustic was easy to follow  even in the faltering dark  for he was enlivening his wavering walk with song .', 'it was an interminable poem  beginning with some unspecified king william  who  it appeared  lived in london town and who after the second rise vanished rather abruptly from the train of thought .', 'the rest was almost entirely about beer and was thick with local topography of a quite unrecognizable kind .', 'the singer  s step was neither very rapid  nor  indeed  exceptionally secure  so the song grew louder and louder and the two soon overtook him .', 'he was a man elderly or rather of any age  with lean grey hair and a lean red face  but with that remarkable rustic physiognomy in which it seems that all the features stand out independently from the face  the rugged red nose going out like a limb  the bleared blue eyes standing out like signals .', 'he gave them greeting with the elaborate urbanity of the slightly intoxicated .', 'macian  who was vibrating with one of his silent  violent decisions  opened the question without delay .', 'he explained the philosophic position in words as short and simple as possible .', 'but the singular old man with the lank red face seemed to think uncommonly little of the short words .', 'he fixed with a fierce affection upon one or two of the long ones .', ' atheists ', 'he repeated with luxurious scorn .', ' atheists ', 'i know their sort  master .', 'atheists ', 'don  t talk to me about  un .', 'atheists ', 'the grounds of his disdain seemed a little dark and confused  but they were evidently sufficient .', 'macian resumed in some encouragement ', ' you think as i do  i hope  you think that a man should be connected with the church  with the common christian ', 'the old man extended a quivering stick in the direction of a distant hill .', ' there  s the church  he said thickly .', ' grassley old church that is .', 'pulled down it was  in the old squire  s time  and ', ' i mean  explained macian elaborately   that you think that there should be someone typifying religion  a priest ', ' priests ', 'said the old man with sudden passion .', ' priests ', 'i know  un .', 'what they want in england ', 'that  s what i say .', 'what they want in england ', ' they want you  said macian .', ' quite so  said turnbull   and me  but they won  t get us .', 'macian  your attempt on the primitive innocence does not seem very successful .', 'let me try .', 'what you want  my friend  is your rights .', 'you don  t want any priests or churches .', 'a vote  a right to speak is what you ', ' who says i a  n  t got a right to speak ', 'said the old man  facing round in an irrational frenzy .', ' i got a right to speak .', 'i  m a man  i am .', 'i don  t want no votin  nor priests .', 'i say a man  s a man  that  s what i say .', 'if a man a  n  t a man  what is he ', 'that  s what i say  if a man a  n  t a man  what is he ', 'when i sees a man  i sez  e  s a man .', ' quite so  said turnbull   a citizen .', ' i say he  s a man  said the rustic furiously  stopping and striking his stick on the ground .', ' not a city or owt else .', 'he  s a man .', ' you  re perfectly right  said the sudden voice of macian  falling like a sword .', ' and you have kept close to something the whole world of today tries to forget .', ' good night .', 'and the old man went on wildly singing into the night .', ' a jolly old creature  said turnbull   he didn  t seem able to get much beyond that fact that a man is a man .', ' has anybody got beyond it ', 'asked macian .', 'turnbull looked at him curiously .', ' are you turning an agnostic ', 'he asked .', ' oh  you do not understand ', 'cried out macian .', ' we catholics are all agnostics .', 'we catholics have only in that sense got as far as realizing that man is a man .', 'but your ibsens and your zolas and your shaws and your tolstoys have not even got so far .', 'viii .', 'an interlude of argument', 'morning broke in bitter silver along the grey and level plain  and almost as it did so turnbull and macian came out of a low  scrubby wood on to the empty and desolate flats .', 'they had walked all night .', 'they had walked all night and talked all night also  and if the subject had been capable of being exhausted they would have exhausted it .', 'their long and changing argument had taken them through districts and landscapes equally changing .', 'they had discussed haeckel upon hills so high and steep that in spite of the coldness of the night it seemed as if the stars might burn them .', 'they had explained and re  explained the massacre of st . bartholomew in little white lanes walled in with standing corn as with walls of gold .', 'they had talked about mr . kensit in dim and twinkling pine woods  amid the bewildering monotony of the pines .', 'and it was with the end of a long speech from macian  passionately defending the practical achievements and the solid prosperity of the catholic tradition  that they came out upon the open land .', 'macian had learnt much and thought more since he came out of the cloudy hills of arisaig .', 'he had met many typical modern figures under circumstances which were sharply symbolic  and  moreover  he had absorbed the main modern atmosphere from the mere presence and chance phrases of turnbull  as such atmospheres can always be absorbed from the presence and the phrases of any man of great mental vitality .', 'he had at last begun thoroughly to understand what are the grounds upon which the mass of the modern world solidly disapprove of her creed  and he threw himself into replying to them with a hot intellectual enjoyment .', ' i begin to understand one or two of your dogmas  mr . turnbull  he had said emphatically as they ploughed heavily up a wooded hill .', ' and every one that i understand i deny .', 'take any one of them you like .', 'you hold that your heretics and sceptics have helped the world forward and handed on a lamp of progress .', 'i deny it .', 'nothing is plainer from real history than that each of your heretics invented a complete cosmos of his own which the next heretic smashed entirely to pieces .', 'who knows now exactly what nestorius taught ', 'who cares ', 'there are only two things that we know for certain about it .', 'the first is that nestorius  as a heretic  taught something quite opposite to the teaching of arius  the heretic who came before him  and something quite useless to james turnbull  the heretic who comes after .', 'i defy you to go back to the free  thinkers of the past and find any habitation for yourself at all .', 'i defy you to read godwin or shelley or the deists of the eighteenth century of the nature  worshipping humanists of the renaissance  without discovering that you differ from them twice as much as you differ from the pope .', 'you are a nineteenth  century sceptic  and you are always telling me that i ignore the cruelty of nature .', 'if you had been an eighteenth  century sceptic you would have told me that i ignore the kindness and benevolence of nature .', 'you are an atheist  and you praise the deists of the eighteenth century .', 'read them instead of praising them  and you will find that their whole universe stands or falls with the deity .', 'you are a materialist  and you think bruno a scientific hero .', 'see what he said and you will think him an insane mystic .', 'no  the great free  thinker  with his genuine ability and honesty  does not in practice destroy christianity .', 'what he does destroy is the free  thinker who went before .', 'free  thought may be suggestive  it may be inspiriting  it may have as much as you please of the merits that come from vivacity and variety .', 'but there is one thing free  thought can never be by any possibility  free  thought can never be progressive .', 'it can never be progressive because it will accept nothing from the past  it begins every time again from the beginning  and it goes every time in a different direction .', 'all the rational philosophers have gone along different roads  so it is impossible to say which has gone farthest .', 'who can discuss whether emerson was a better optimist than schopenhauer was pessimist ', 'it is like asking if this corn is as yellow as that hill is steep .', 'no  there are only two things that really progress  and they both accept accumulations of authority .', 'they may be progressing uphill and down  they may be growing steadily better or steadily worse  but they have steadily increased in certain definable matters  they have steadily advanced in a certain definable direction  they are the only two things  it seems  that ever can progress .', 'the first is strictly physical science .', 'the second is the catholic church .', ' physical science and the catholic church ', 'said turnbull sarcastically   and no doubt the first owes a great deal to the second .', ' if you pressed that point i might reply that it was very probable  answered macian calmly .', ' i often fancy that your historical generalizations rest frequently on random instances  i should not be surprised if your vague notions of the church as the persecutor of science was a generalization from galileo .', 'i should not be at all surprised if  when you counted the scientific investigations and discoveries since the fall of rome  you found that a great mass of them had been made by monks .', 'but the matter is irrelevant to my meaning .', 'i say that if you want an example of anything which has progressed in the moral world by the same method as science in the material world  by continually adding to without unsettling what was there before  then i say that there is only one example of it .', 'and that is us .', ' with this enormous difference  said turnbull   that however elaborate be the calculations of physical science  their net result can be tested .', 'granted that it took millions of books i never read and millions of men i never heard of to discover the electric light .', 'still i can see the electric light .', 'but i cannot see the supreme virtue which is the result of all your theologies and sacraments .', ' catholic virtue is often invisible because it is the normal  answered macian .', ' christianity is always out of fashion because it is always sane  and all fashions are mild insanities .', 'when italy is mad on art the church seems too puritanical  when england is mad on puritanism the church seems too artistic .', 'when you quarrel with us now you class us with kingship and despotism  but when you quarrelled with us first it was because we would not accept the divine despotism of henry viii .', 'the church always seems to be behind the times  when it is really beyond the times  it is waiting till the last fad shall have seen its last summer .', 'it keeps the key of a permanent virtue .', ' oh  i have heard all that ', 'said turnbull with genial contempt .', ' i have heard that christianity keeps the key of virtue  and that if you read tom paine you will cut your throat at monte carlo .', 'it is such rubbish that i am not even angry at it .', 'you say that christianity is the prop of morals  but what more do you do ', 'when a doctor attends you and could poison you with a pinch of salt  do you ask whether he is a christian ', 'you ask whether he is a gentleman  whether he is an m . d . anything but that .', 'when a soldier enlists to die for his country or disgrace it  do you ask whether he is a christian ', 'you are more likely to ask whether he is oxford or cambridge at the boat race .', 'if you think your creed essential to morals why do you not make it a test for these things ', ' we once did make it a test for these things  said macian smiling   and then you told us that we were imposing by force a faith unsupported by argument .', 'it seems rather hard that having first been told that our creed must be false because we did use tests  we should now be told that it must be false because we don  t .', 'but i notice that most anti  christian arguments are in the same inconsistent style .', ' that is all very well as a debating  club answer  replied turnbull good  humouredly   but the question still remains  why don  t you confine yourself more to christians if christians are the only really good men ', ' who talked of such folly ', 'asked macian disdainfully .', ' do you suppose that the catholic church ever held that christians were the only good men ', 'why  the catholics of the catholic middle ages talked about the virtues of all the virtuous pagans until humanity was sick of the subject .', 'no  if you really want to know what we mean when we say that christianity has a special power of virtue  i will tell you .', 'the church is the only thing on earth that can perpetuate a type of virtue and make it something more than a fashion .', 'the thing is so plain and historical that i hardly think you will ever deny it .', 'you cannot deny that it is perfectly possible that tomorrow morning  in ireland or in italy  there might appear a man not only as good but good in exactly the same way as st . francis of assisi .', 'very well  now take the other types of human virtue  many of them splendid .', 'the english gentleman of elizabeth was chivalrous and idealistic .', 'but can you stand still here in this meadow and be an english gentleman of elizabeth ', 'the austere republican of the eighteenth century  with his stern patriotism and his simple life  was a fine fellow .', 'but have you ever seen him ', 'have you ever seen an austere republican ', 'only a hundred years have passed and that volcano of revolutionary truth and valour is as cold as the mountains of the moon .', 'and so it is and so it will be with the ethics which are buzzing down fleet street at this instant as i speak .', 'what phrase would inspire the london clerk or workman just now ', 'perhaps that he is a son of the british empire on which the sun never sets  perhaps that he is a prop of his trades union  or a class  conscious proletarian something or other  perhaps merely that he is a gentleman when he obviously is not .', 'those names and notions are all honourable  but how long will they last ', 'empires break  industrial conditions change  the suburbs will not last for ever .', 'what will remain ', 'i will tell you .', 'the catholic saint will remain .', ' and suppose i don  t like him ', 'said turnbull .', ' on my theory the question is rather whether he will like you  or more probably whether he will ever have heard of you .', 'but i grant the reasonableness of your query .', 'you have a right  if you speak as the ordinary man  to ask if you will like the saint .', 'but as the ordinary man you do like him .', 'you revel in him .', 'if you dislike him it is not because you are a nice ordinary man  but because you are  if you will excuse me  a sophisticated prig of a fleet street editor .', 'that is just the funny part of it .', 'the human race has always admired the catholic virtues  however little it can practise them  and oddly enough it has admired most those of them that the modern world most sharply disputes .', 'you complain of catholicism for setting up an ideal of virginity  it did nothing of the kind .', 'the whole human race set up an ideal of virginity  the greeks in athene  the romans in the vestal fire  set up an ideal of virginity .', 'what then is your real quarrel with catholicism ', 'your quarrel can only be  your quarrel really only is  that catholicism has achieved an ideal of virginity  that it is no longer a mere piece of floating poetry .', 'but if you  and a few feverish men  in top hats  running about in a street in london  choose to differ as to the ideal itself  not only from the church  but from the parthenon whose name means virginity  from the roman empire which went outwards from the virgin flame  from the whole legend and tradition of europe  from the lion who will not touch virgins  from the unicorn who respects them  and who make up together the bearers of your own national shield  from the most living and lawless of your own poets  from massinger  who wrote the virgin martyr  from shakespeare  who wrote measure for measure  if you in fleet street differ from all this human experience  does it never strike you that it may be fleet street that is wrong ', ' no  answered turnbull   i trust that i am sufficiently fair  minded to canvass and consider the idea  but having considered it  i think fleet street is right  yes  even if the parthenon is wrong .', 'i think that as the world goes on new psychological atmospheres are generated  and in these atmospheres it is possible to find delicacies and combinations which in other times would have to be represented by some ruder symbol .', 'every man feels the need of some element of purity in sex  perhaps they can only typify purity as the absence of sex .', 'you will laugh if i suggest that we may have made in fleet street an atmosphere in which a man can be so passionate as sir lancelot and as pure as sir galahad .', 'but  after all  we have in the modern world erected many such atmospheres .', 'we have  for instance  a new and imaginative appreciation of children .', ' quite so  replied macian with a singular smile .', ' it has been very well put by one of the brightest of your young authors  who said   unless you become as little children ye shall in no wise enter the kingdom of heaven .', 'but you are quite right  there is a modern worship of children .', 'and what  i ask you  is this modern worship of children ', 'what  in the name of all the angels and devils  is it except a worship of virginity ', 'why should anyone worship a thing merely because it is small or immature ', 'no  you have tried to escape from this thing  and the very thing you point to as the goal of your escape is only the thing again .', 'am i wrong in saying that these things seem to be eternal ', 'and it was with these words that they came in sight of the great plains .', 'they went a little way in silence  and then james turnbull said suddenly   but i cannot believe in the thing .', 'macian answered nothing to the speech  perhaps it is unanswerable .', 'and indeed they scarcely spoke another word to each other all that day .', 'ix .', 'the strange lady', 'moonrise with a great and growing moon opened over all those flats  making them seem flatter and larger than they were  turning them to a lake of blue light .', 'the two companions trudged across the moonlit plain for half an hour in full silence .', 'then macian stopped suddenly and planted his sword  point in the ground like one who plants his tent  pole for the night .', 'leaving it standing there  he clutched his black  haired skull with his great claws of hands  as was his custom when forcing the pace of his brain .', 'then his hands dropped again and he spoke .', ' i  m sure you  re thinking the same as i am  he said   how long are we to be on this damned seesaw ', 'the other did not answer  but his silence seemed somehow solid as assent  and macian went on conversationally .', 'neither noticed that both had instinctively stood still before the sign of the fixed and standing sword .', ' it is hard to guess what god means in this business .', 'but he means something  or the other thing  or both .', 'whenever we have tried to fight each other something has stopped us .', 'whenever we have tried to be reconciled to each other  something has stopped us again .', 'by the run of our luck we have never had time to be either friends or enemies .', 'something always jumped out of the bushes .', 'turnbull nodded gravely and glanced round at the huge and hedgeless meadow which fell away towards the horizon into a glimmering high road .', ' nothing will jump out of bushes here anyhow  he said .', ' that is what i meant  said macian  and stared steadily at the heavy hilt of his standing sword  which in the slight wind swayed on its tempered steel like some huge thistle on its stalk .', ' that is what i meant  we are quite alone here .', 'i have not heard a horse  hoof or a footstep or the hoot of a train for miles .', 'so i think we might stop here and ask for a miracle .', ' oh ', 'might we ', 'said the atheistic editor with a sort of gusto of disgust .', ' i beg your pardon  said macian  meekly .', ' i forgot your prejudices .', 'he eyed the wind  swung sword  hilt in sad meditation and resumed   what i mean is  we might find out in this quiet place whether there really is any fate or any commandment against our enterprise .', 'i will engage on my side  like elijah  to accept a test from heaven .', 'turnbull  let us draw swords here in this moonlight and this monstrous solitude .', 'and if here in this moonlight and solitude there happens anything to interrupt us  if it be lightning striking our sword  blades or a rabbit running under our legs  i will take it as a sign from god and we will shake hands for ever .', 'turnbull  s mouth twitched in angry humour under his red moustache .', 'he said   i will wait for signs from god until i have any signs of his existence  but god  or fate  forbid that a man of scientific culture should refuse any kind of experiment .', ' very well  then  said macian  shortly .', ' we are more quiet here than anywhere else  let us engage .', 'and he plucked his sword  point out of the turf .', 'turnbull regarded him for a second and a half with a baffling visage almost black against the moonrise  then his hand made a sharp movement to his hip and his sword shone in the moon .', 'as old chess  players open every game with established gambits  they opened with a thrust and parry  orthodox and even frankly ineffectual .', 'but in macian  s soul more formless storms were gathering  and he made a lunge or two so savage as first to surprise and then to enrage his opponent .', 'turnbull ground his teeth  kept his temper  and waiting for the third lunge  and the worst  had almost spitted the lunger when a shrill  small cry came from behind him  a cry such as is not made by any of the beasts that perish .', 'turnbull must have been more superstitious than he knew  for he stopped in the act of going forward .', 'macian was brazenly superstitious  and he dropped his sword .', 'after all  he had challenged the universe to send an interruption  and this was an interruption  whatever else it was .', 'an instant afterwards the sharp  weak cry was repeated .', 'this time it was certain that it was human and that it was female .', 'macian stood rolling those great blue gaelic eyes that contrasted with his dark hair .', ' it is the voice of god  he said again and again .', ' god hasn  t got much of a voice  said turnbull  who snatched at every chance of cheap profanity .', ' as a matter of fact  macian  it isn  t the voice of god  but it  s something a jolly sight more important  it is the voice of man  or rather of woman .', 'so i think we  d better scoot in its direction .', 'macian snatched up his fallen weapon without a word  and the two raced away towards that part of the distant road from which the cry was now constantly renewed .', 'they had to run over a curve of country that looked smooth but was very rough  a neglected field which they soon found to be full of the tallest grasses and the deepest rabbit  holes .', 'moreover  that great curve of the countryside which looked so slow and gentle when you glanced over it  proved to be highly precipitous when you scampered over it  and turnbull was twice nearly flung on his face .', 'macian  though much heavier  avoided such an overthrow only by having the quick and incalculable feet of the mountaineer  but both of them may be said to have leapt off a low cliff when they leapt into the road .', 'the moonlight lay on the white road with a more naked and electric glare than on the grey  green upland  and though the scene which it revealed was complicated  it was not difficult to get its first features at a glance .', 'a small but very neat black  and  yellow motor  car was standing stolidly  slightly to the left of the road .', 'a somewhat larger light  green motor  car was tipped half  way into a ditch on the same side  and four flushed and staggering men in evening dress were tipped out of it .', 'three of them were standing about the road  giving their opinions to the moon with vague but echoing violence .', 'the fourth  however  had already advanced on the chauffeur of the black  and  yellow car  and was threatening him with a stick .', 'the chauffeur had risen to defend himself .', 'by his side sat a young lady .', 'she was sitting bolt upright  a slender and rigid figure gripping the sides of her seat  and her first few cries had ceased .', 'she was clad in close  fitting dark costume  a mass of warm brown hair went out in two wings or waves on each side of her forehead  and even at that distance it could be seen that her profile was of the aquiline and eager sort  like a young falcon hardly free of the nest .', 'turnbull had concealed in him somewhere a fund of common sense and knowledge of the world of which he himself and his best friends were hardly aware .', 'he was one of those who take in much of the shows of things absent  mindedly  and in an irrelevant reverie .', 'as he stood at the door of his editorial shop on ludgate hill and meditated on the non  existence of god  he silently absorbed a good deal of varied knowledge about the existence of men .', 'he had come to know types by instinct and dilemmas with a glance  he saw the crux of the situation in the road  and what he saw made him redouble his pace .', 'he knew that the men were rich  he knew that they were drunk  and he knew  what was worst of all  that they were fundamentally frightened .', 'and he knew this also  that no common ruffian  such as attacks ladies in novels  is ever so savage and ruthless as a coarse kind of gentleman when he is really alarmed .', 'the reason is not recondite  it is simply because the police  court is not such a menacing novelty to the poor ruffian as it is to the rich .', 'when they came within hail and heard the voices  they confirmed all turnbull  s anticipations .', 'the man in the middle of the road was shouting in a hoarse and groggy voice that the chauffeur had smashed their car on purpose  that they must get to the cri that evening  and that he would jolly well have to take them there .', 'the chauffeur had mildly objected that he was driving a lady .', ' oh ', 'we  ll take care of the lady  said the red  faced young man  and went off into gurgling and almost senile laughter .', 'by the time the two champions came up  things had grown more serious .', 'the intoxication of the man talking to the chauffeur had taken one of its perverse and catlike jumps into mere screaming spite and rage .', 'he lifted his stick and struck at the chauffeur  who caught hold of it  and the drunkard fell backwards  dragging him out of his seat on the car .', 'another of the rowdies rushed forward booing in idiot excitement  fell over the chauffeur  and  either by accident or design  kicked him as he lay .', 'the drunkard got to his feet again  but the chauffeur did not .', 'the man who had kicked kept a kind of half  witted conscience or cowardice  for he stood staring at the senseless body and murmuring words of inconsequent self  justification  making gestures with his hands as if he were arguing with somebody .', 'but the other three  with a mere whoop and howl of victory  were boarding the car on three sides at once .', 'it was exactly at this moment that turnbull fell among them like one fallen from the sky .', 'he tore one of the climbers backward by the collar  and with a hearty push sent him staggering over into the ditch upon his nose .', 'one of the remaining two  who was too far gone to notice anything  continued to clamber ineffectually over the high back of the car  kicking and pouring forth a rivulet of soliloquy .', 'but the other dropped at the interruption  turned upon turnbull and began a battering bout of fisticuffs .', 'at the same moment the man crawled out of the ditch in a masquerade of mud and rushed at his old enemy from behind .', 'the whole had not taken a second  and an instant after macian was in the midst of them .', 'turnbull had tossed away his sheathed sword  greatly preferring his hands  except in the avowed etiquette of the duel  for he had learnt to use his hands in the old street  battles of bradlaugh .', 'but to macian the sword even sheathed was a more natural weapon  and he laid about him on all sides with it as with a stick .', 'the man who had the walking  stick found his blows parried with promptitude  and a second after  to his great astonishment  found his own stick fly up in the air as by a conjuring trick  with a turn of the swordsman  s wrist .', 'another of the revellers picked the stick out of the ditch and ran in upon macian  calling to his companion to assist him .', ' i haven  t got a stick  grumbled the disarmed man  and looked vaguely about the ditch .', ' perhaps  said macian  politely   you would like this one .', 'with the word the drunkard found his hand that had grasped the stick suddenly twisted and empty  and the stick lay at the feet of his companion on the other side of the road .', 'macian felt a faint stir behind him  the girl had risen to her feet and was leaning forward to stare at the fighters .', 'turnbull was still engaged in countering and pommelling with the third young man .', 'the fourth young man was still engaged with himself  kicking his legs in helpless rotation on the back of the car and talking with melodious rationality .', 'at length turnbull  s opponent began to back before the battery of his heavy hands  still fighting  for he was the soberest and boldest of the four .', 'if these are annals of military glory  it is due to him to say that he need not have abandoned the conflict  only that as he backed to the edge of the ditch his foot caught in a loop of grass and he went over in a flat and comfortable position from which it took him a considerable time to rise .', 'by the time he had risen  turnbull had come to the rescue of macian  who was at bay but belabouring his two enemies handsomely .', 'the sight of the liberated reserve was to them like that of blucher at waterloo  the two set off at a sullen trot down the road  leaving even the walking  stick lying behind them in the moonlight .', 'macian plucked the struggling and aspiring idiot off the back of the car like a stray cat  and left him swaying unsteadily in the moon .', 'then he approached the front part of the car in a somewhat embarrassed manner and pulled off his cap .', 'for some solid seconds the lady and he merely looked at each other  and macian had an irrational feeling of being in a picture hung on a wall .', 'that is  he was motionless  even lifeless  and yet staringly significant  like a picture .', 'the white moonlight on the road  when he was not looking at it  gave him a vision of the road being white with snow .', 'the motor  car  when he was not looking at it  gave him a rude impression of a captured coach in the old days of highwaymen .', 'and he whose whole soul was with the swords and stately manners of the eighteenth century  he who was a jacobite risen from the dead  had an overwhelming sense of being once more in the picture  when he had so long been out of the picture .', 'in that short and strong silence he absorbed the lady from head to foot .', 'he had never really looked at a human being before in his life .', 'he saw her face and hair first  then that she had long suede gloves  then that there was a fur cap at the back of her brown hair .', 'he might  perhaps  be excused for this hungry attention .', 'he had prayed that some sign might come from heaven  and after an almost savage scrutiny he came to the conclusion that his one did .', 'the lady  s instantaneous arrest of speech might need more explaining  but she may well have been stunned with the squalid attack and the abrupt rescue .', 'yet it was she who remembered herself first and suddenly called out with self  accusing horror ', ' oh  that poor  poor man ', 'they both swung round abruptly and saw that turnbull  with his recovered sword under his arm  pit  was already lifting the fallen chauffeur into the car .', 'he was only stunned and was slowly awakening  feebly waving his left arm .', 'the lady in long gloves and the fur cap leapt out and ran rapidly towards them  only to be reassured by turnbull  who  unlike many of his school  really knew a little science when he invoked it to redeem the world .', ' he  s all right  said he   he  s quite safe .', 'but i  m afraid he won  t be able to drive the car for half an hour or so .', ' i can drive the car  said the young woman in the fur cap with stony practicability .', ' oh  in that case  began macian  uneasily  and that paralysing shyness which is a part of romance induced him to make a backward movement as if leaving her to herself .', 'but turnbull was more rational than he  being more indifferent .', ' i don  t think you ought to drive home alone  ma  am  he said  gruffly .', ' there seem to be a lot of rowdy parties along this road  and the man will be no use for an hour .', 'if you will tell us where you are going  we will see you safely there and say good night .', 'the young lady exhibited all the abrupt disturbance of a person who is not commonly disturbed .', 'she said almost sharply and yet with evident sincerity   of course i am awfully grateful to you for all you  ve done  and there  s plenty of room if you  ll come in .', 'turnbull  with the complete innocence of an absolutely sound motive  immediately jumped into the car  but the girl cast an eye at macian  who stood in the road for an instant as if rooted like a tree .', 'then he also tumbled his long legs into the tonneau  having that sense of degradedly diving into heaven which so many have known in so many human houses when they consented to stop to tea or were allowed to stop to supper .', 'the slowly reviving chauffeur was set in the back seat  turnbull and macian had fallen into the middle one  the lady with a steely coolness had taken the driver  s seat and all the handles of that headlong machine .', 'a moment afterwards the engine started  with a throb and leap unfamiliar to turnbull  who had only once been in a motor during a general election  and utterly unknown to macian  who in his present mood thought it was the end of the world .', 'almost at the same instant that the car plucked itself out of the mud and whipped away up the road  the man who had been flung into the ditch rose waveringly to his feet .', 'when he saw the car escaping he ran after it and shouted something which  owing to the increasing distance  could not be heard .', 'it is awful to reflect that  if his remark was valuable  it is quite lost to the world .', 'the car shot on up and down the shining moonlit lanes  and there was no sound in it except the occasional click or catch of its machinery  for through some cause or other no soul inside it could think of a word to say .', 'the lady symbolized her feelings  whatever they were  by urging the machine faster and faster until scattered woodlands went by them in one black blotch and heavy hills and valleys seemed to ripple under the wheels like mere waves .', 'a little while afterwards this mood seemed to slacken and she fell into a more ordinary pace  but still she did not speak .', 'turnbull  who kept a more common and sensible view of the case than anyone else  made some remark about the moonlight  but something indescribable made him also relapse into silence .', 'all this time macian had been in a sort of monstrous delirium  like some fabulous hero snatched up into the moon .', 'the difference between this experience and common experiences was analogous to that between waking life and a dream .', 'yet he did not feel in the least as if he were dreaming  rather the other way  as waking was more actual than dreaming  so this seemed by another degree more actual than waking itself .', 'but it was another life altogether  like a cosmos with a new dimension .', 'he felt he had been hurled into some new incarnation  into the midst of new relations  wrongs and rights  with towering responsibilities and almost tragic joys which he had as yet had no time to examine .', 'heaven had not merely sent him a message  heaven itself had opened around him and given him an hour of its own ancient and star  shattering energy .', 'he had never felt so much alive before  and yet he was like a man in a trance .', 'and if you had asked him on what his throbbing happiness hung  he could only have told you that it hung on four or five visible facts  as a curtain hangs on four of five fixed nails .', 'the fact that the lady had a little fur at her throat  the fact that the curve of her cheek was a low and lean curve and that the moonlight caught the height of her cheek  bone  the fact that her hands were small but heavily gloved as they gripped the steering  wheel  the fact that a white witch light was on the road  the fact that the brisk breeze of their passage stirred and fluttered a little not only the brown hair of her head but the black fur on her cap .', 'all these facts were to him certain and incredible  like sacraments .', 'when they had driven half a mile farther  a big shadow was flung across the path  followed by its bulky owner  who eyed the car critically but let it pass .', 'the silver moonlight picked out a piece or two of pewter ornament on his blue uniform  and as they went by they knew it was a sergeant of police .', 'three hundred yards farther on another policeman stepped out into the road as if to stop them  then seemed to doubt his own authority and stepped back again .', 'the girl was a daughter of the rich  and this police suspicion  under which all the poor live day and night  stung her for the first time into speech .', ' what can they mean ', 'she cried out in a kind of temper   this car  s going like a snail .', 'there was a short silence  and then turnbull said   it is certainly very odd  you are driving quietly enough .', ' you are driving nobly  said macian  and his words  which had no meaning whatever  sounded hoarse and ungainly even in his own ears .', 'they passed the next mile and a half swiftly and smoothly  yet among the many things which they passed in the course of it was a clump of eager policemen standing at a cross  road .', 'as they passed  one of the policemen shouted something to the others  but nothing else happened .', 'eight hundred yards farther on  turnbull stood up suddenly in the swaying car .', ' my god  macian ', 'he called out  showing his first emotion of that night .', ' i don  t believe it  s the pace  it couldn  t be the pace .', 'i believe it  s us .', 'macian sat motionless for a few moments and then turned up at his companion a face that was as white as the moon above it .', ' you may be right  he said at last   if you are  i must tell her .', ' i will tell the lady if you like  said turnbull  with his unconquered good temper .', ' you ', 'said macian  with a sort of sincere and instinctive astonishment .', ' why should you  no  i must tell her  of course ', 'and he leant forward and spoke to the lady in the fur cap .', ' i am afraid  madam  that we may have got you into some trouble  he said  and even as he said it it sounded wrong  like everything he said to this particular person in the long gloves .', ' the fact is  he resumed  desperately   the fact is  we are being chased by the police .', 'then the last flattening hammer fell upon poor evan  s embarrassment  for the fluffy brown head with the furry black cap did not turn by a section of the compass .', ' we are chased by the police  repeated macian  vigorously  then he added  as if beginning an explanation   you see  i am a catholic .', 'the wind whipped back a curl of the brown hair so as to necessitate a new theory of aesthetics touching the line of the cheek  bone  but the head did not turn .', ' you see  began macian  again blunderingly   this gentleman wrote in his newspaper that our lady was a common woman  a bad woman  and so we agreed to fight  and we were fighting quite a little time ago  but that was before we saw you .', 'the young lady driving her car had half turned her face to listen  and it was not a reverent or a patient face that she showed him .', 'her norman nose was tilted a trifle too high upon the slim stalk of her neck and body .', 'when macian saw that arrogant and uplifted profile pencilled plainly against the moonshine  he accepted an ultimate defeat .', 'he had expected the angels to despise him if he were wrong  but not to despise him so much as this .', ' you see  said the stumbling spokesman   i was angry with him when he insulted the mother of god  and i asked him to fight a duel with me  but the police are all trying to stop it .', 'nothing seemed to waver or flicker in the fair young falcon profile  and it only opened its lips to say  after a silence   i thought people in our time were supposed to respect each other  s religion .', 'under the shadow of that arrogant face macian could only fall back on the obvious answer   but what about a man  s irreligion ', 'the face only answered   well  you ought to be more broadminded .', 'if anyone else in the world had said the words  macian would have snorted with his equine neigh of scorn .', 'but in this case he seemed knocked down by a superior simplicity  as if his eccentric attitude were rebuked by the innocence of a child .', 'he could not dissociate anything that this woman said or did or wore from an idea of spiritual rarity and virtue .', 'like most others under the same elemental passion  his soul was at present soaked in ethics .', 'he could have applied moral terms to the material objects of her environment .', 'if someone had spoken of  her generous ribbon  or  her chivalrous gloves  or  her merciful shoe  buckle  it would not have seemed to him nonsense .', 'he was silent  and the girl went on in a lower key as if she were momentarily softened and a little saddened also .', ' it won  t do  you know  she said   you can  t find out the truth in that way .', 'there are such heaps of churches and people thinking different things nowadays  and they all think they are right .', 'my uncle was a swedenborgian .', 'macian sat with bowed head  listening hungrily to her voice but hardly to her words  and seeing his great world drama grow smaller and smaller before his eyes till it was no bigger than a child  s toy theatre .', ' the time  s gone by for all that  she went on   you can  t find out the real thing like that  if there is really anything to find  and she sighed rather drearily  for  like many of the women of our wealthy class  she was old and broken in thought  though young and clean enough in her emotions .', ' our object  said turnbull  shortly   is to make an effective demonstration  and after that word  macian looked at his vision again and found it smaller than ever .', ' it would be in the newspapers  of course  said the girl .', ' people read the newspapers  but they don  t believe them  or anything else  i think .', 'and she sighed again .', 'she drove in silence a third of a mile before she added  as if completing the sentence   anyhow  the whole thing  s quite absurd .', ' i don  t think  began turnbull   that you quite realize  hullo ', 'hullo  hullo  what  s this ', 'the amateur chauffeur had been forced to bring the car to a staggering stoppage  for a file of fat  blue policemen made a wall across the way .', 'a sergeant came to the side and touched his peaked cap to the lady .', ' beg your pardon  miss  he said with some embarrassment  for he knew her for a daughter of a dominant house   but we have reason to believe that the gentlemen in your car are  and he hesitated for a polite phrase .', ' i am evan macian  said that gentleman  and stood up in a sort of gloomy pomp  not wholly without a touch of the sulks of a schoolboy .', ' yes  we will get out  sergeant  said turnbull  more easily   my name is james turnbull .', 'we must not incommode the lady .', ' what are you taking them up for ', 'asked the young woman  looking straight in front of her along the road .', ' it  s under the new act  said the sergeant  almost apologetically .', ' incurable disturbers of the peace .', ' what will happen to them ', 'she asked  with the same frigid clearness .', ' westgate adult reformatory  he replied  briefly .', ' until when ', ' until they are cured  said the official .', ' very well  sergeant  said the young lady  with a sort of tired common sense .', ' i am sure i don  t want to protect criminals or go against the law  but i must tell you that these gentlemen have done me a considerable service  you won  t mind drawing your men a little farther off while i say good night to them .', 'men like that always misunderstand .', 'the sergeant was profoundly disquieted from the beginning at the mere idea of arresting anyone in the company of a great lady  to refuse one of her minor requests was quite beyond his courage .', 'the police fell back to a few yards behind the car .', 'turnbull took up the two swords that were their only luggage  the swords that  after so many half duels  they were now to surrender at last .', 'macian  the blood thundering in his brain at the thought of that instant of farewell  bent over  fumbled at the handle and flung open the door to get out .', 'but he did not get out .', 'he did not get out  because it is dangerous to jump out of a car when it is going at full speed .', 'and the car was going at full speed  because the young lady  without turning her head or so much as saying a syllable  had driven down a handle that made the machine plunge forward like a buffalo and then fly over the landscape like a greyhound .', 'the police made one rush to follow  and then dropped so grotesque and hopeless a chase .', 'away in the vanishing distance they could see the sergeant furiously making notes .', 'the open door  still left loose on its hinges  swung and banged quite crazily as they went whizzing up one road and down another .', 'nor did macian sit down  he stood up stunned and yet staring  as he would have stood up at the trumpet of the last day .', 'a black dot in the distance sprang up a tall black forest  swallowed them and spat them out again at the other end .', 'a railway bridge grew larger and larger till it leapt upon their backs bellowing  and was in its turn left behind .', 'avenues of poplars on both sides of the road chased each other like the figures in a zoetrope .', 'now and then with a shock and rattle they went through sleeping moonlit villages  which must have stirred an instant in their sleep as at the passing of a fugitive earthquake .', 'sometimes in an outlying house a light in one erratic  unexpected window would give them a nameless hint of the hundred human secrets which they left behind them with their dust .', 'sometimes even a slouching rustic would be afoot on the road and would look after them  as after a flying phantom .', 'but still macian stood up staring at earth and heaven  and still the door he had flung open flapped loose like a flag .', 'turnbull  after a few minutes of dumb amazement  had yielded to the healthiest element in his nature and gone off into uncontrollable fits of laughter .', 'the girl had not stirred an inch .', 'after another half mile that seemed a mere flash  turnbull leant over and locked the door .', 'evan staggered at last into his seat and hid his throbbing head in his hands  and still the car flew on and its driver sat inflexible and silent .', 'the moon had already gone down  and the whole darkness was faintly troubled with twilight and the first movement of beasts and fowls .', 'it was that mysterious moment when light is coming as if it were something unknown whose nature one could not guess  a mere alteration in everything .', 'they looked at the sky and it seemed as dark as ever  then they saw the black shape of a tower or tree against it and knew that it was already grey .', 'save that they were driving southward and had certainly passed the longitude of london  they knew nothing of their direction  but turnbull  who had spent a year on the hampshire coast in his youth  began to recognize the unmistakable but quite indescribable villages of the english south .', 'then a white witch fire began to burn between the black stems of the fir  trees  and  like so many things in nature  though not in books on evolution  the daybreak  when it did come  came much quicker than one would think .', 'the gloomy heavens were ripped up and rolled away like a scroll  revealing splendours  as the car went roaring up the curve of a great hill  and above them and black against the broadening light  there stood one of those crouching and fantastic trees that are first signals of the sea .', 'x .', 'the swords rejoined', 'as they came over the hill and down on the other side of it  it is not too much to say that the whole universe of god opened over them and under them  like a thing unfolding to five times its size .', 'almost under their feet opened the enormous sea  at the bottom of a steep valley which fell down into a bay  and the sea under their feet blazed at them almost as lustrous and almost as empty as the sky .', 'the sunrise opened above them like some cosmic explosion  shining and shattering and yet silent  as if the world were blown to pieces without a sound .', 'round the rays of the victorious sun swept a sort of rainbow of confused and conquered colours  brown and blue and green and flaming rose  colour  as though gold were driving before it all the colours of the world .', 'the lines of the landscape down which they sped  were the simple  strict  yet swerving  lines of a rushing river  so that it was almost as if they were being sucked down in a huge still whirlpool .', 'turnbull had some such feeling  for he spoke for the first time for many hours .', ' if we go down at this rate we shall be over the sea cliff  he said .', ' how glorious ', 'said macian .', 'when  however  they had come into the wide hollow at the bottom of that landslide  the car took a calm and graceful curve along the side of the sea  melted into the fringe of a few trees  and quietly  yet astonishingly  stopped .', 'a belated light was burning in the broad morning in the window of a sort of lodge  or gate  keepers  cottage  and the girl stood up in the car and turned her splendid face to the sun .', 'evan seemed startled by the stillness  like one who had been born amid sound and speed .', 'he wavered on his long legs as he stood up  he pulled himself together  and the only consequence was that he trembled from head to foot .', 'turnbull had already opened the door on his side and jumped out .', 'the moment he had done so the strange young woman had one more mad movement  and deliberately drove the car a few yards farther .', 'then she got out with an almost cruel coolness and began pulling off her long gloves and almost whistling .', ' you can leave me here  she said  quite casually  as if they had met five minutes before .', ' that is the lodge of my father  s place .', 'please come in  if you like  but i understood that you had some business .', 'evan looked at that lifted face and found it merely lovely  he was far too much of a fool to see that it was working with a final fatigue and that its austerity was agony .', 'he was even fool enough to ask it a question .', ' why did you save us ', 'he said  quite humbly .', 'the girl tore off one of her gloves  as if she were tearing off her hand .', ' oh  i don  t know  she said  bitterly .', ' now i come to think of it  i can  t imagine .', 'evan  s thoughts  that had been piled up to the morning star  abruptly let him down with a crash into the very cellars of the emotional universe .', 'he remained in a stunned silence for a long time  and that  if he had only known  was the wisest thing that he could possibly do at the moment .', 'indeed  the silence and the sunrise had their healing effect  for when the extraordinary lady spoke again  her tone was more friendly and apologetic .', ' i  m not really ungrateful  she said   it was very good of you to save me from those men .', ' but why ', 'repeated the obstinate and dazed macian   why did you save us from the other men ', 'i mean the policemen ', 'the girl  s great brown eyes were lit up with a flash that was at once final desperation and the loosening of some private and passionate reserve .', ' oh  god knows ', 'she cried .', ' god knows that if there is a god he has turned his big back on everything .', 'god knows i have had no pleasure in my life  though i am pretty and young and father has plenty of money .', 'and then people come and tell me that i ought to do things and i do them and it  s all drivel .', 'they want you to do work among the poor  which means reading ruskin and feeling self  righteous in the best room in a poor tenement .', 'or to help some cause or other  which always means bundling people out of crooked houses  in which they  ve always lived  into straight houses  in which they often die .', 'and all the time you have inside only the horrid irony of your own empty head and empty heart .', 'i am to give to the unfortunate  when my whole misfortune is that i have nothing to give .', 'i am to teach  when i believe nothing at all that i was taught .', 'i am to save the children from death  and i am not even certain that i should not be better dead .', 'i suppose if i actually saw a child drowning i should save it .', 'but that would be from the same motive from which i have saved you  or destroyed you  whichever it is that i have done .', ' what was the motive ', 'asked evan  in a low voice .', ' my motive is too big for my mind  answered the girl .', 'then  after a pause  as she stared with a rising colour at the glittering sea  she said   it can  t be described  and yet i am trying to describe it .', 'it seems to me not only that i am unhappy  but that there is no way of being happy .', 'father is not happy  though he is a member of parliament  she paused a moment and added with a ghost of a smile   nor aunt mabel  though a man from india has told her the secret of all creeds .', 'but i may be wrong  there may be a way out .', 'and for one stark  insane second  i felt that  after all  you had got the way out and that was why the world hated you .', 'you see  if there were a way out  it would be sure to be something that looked very queer .', 'evan put his hand to his forehead and began stumblingly   yes  i suppose we do seem ', ' oh  yes  you look queer enough  she said  with ringing sincerity .', ' you  ll be all the better for a wash and brush up .', ' you forget our business  madam  said evan  in a shaking voice   we have no concern but to kill each other .', ' well  i shouldn  t be killed looking like that if i were you  she replied  with inhuman honesty .', 'evan stood and rolled his eyes in masculine bewilderment .', 'then came the final change in this proteus  and she put out both her hands for an instant and said in a low tone on which he lived for days and nights ', ' don  t you understand that i did not dare to stop you ', 'what you are doing is so mad that it may be quite true .', 'somehow one can never really manage to be an atheist .', 'turnbull stood staring at the sea  but his shoulders showed that he heard  and after one minute he turned his head .', 'but the girl had only brushed evan  s hand with hers and had fled up the dark alley by the lodge gate .', 'evan stood rooted upon the road  literally like some heavy statue hewn there in the age of the druids .', 'it seemed impossible that he should ever move .', 'turnbull grew restless with this rigidity  and at last  after calling his companion twice or thrice  went up and clapped him impatiently on one of his big shoulders .', 'evan winced and leapt away from him with a repulsion which was not the hate of an unclean thing nor the dread of a dangerous one  but was a spasm of awe and separation from something from which he was now sundered as by the sword of god .', 'he did not hate the atheist  it is possible that he loved him .', 'but turnbull was now something more dreadful than an enemy  he was a thing sealed and devoted  a thing now hopelessly doomed to be either a corpse or an executioner .', ' what is the matter with you ', 'asked turnbull  with his hearty hand still in the air  and yet he knew more about it than his innocent action would allow .', ' james  said evan  speaking like one under strong bodily pain   i asked for god  s answer and i have got it  got it in my vitals .', 'he knows how weak i am  and that i might forget the peril of the faith  forget the face of our lady  yes  even with your blow upon her cheek .', 'but the honour of this earth has just this about it  that it can make a man  s heart like iron .', 'i am from the lords of the isles and i dare not be a mere deserter .', 'therefore  god has tied me by the chain of my worldly place and word  and there is nothing but fighting now .', ' i think i understand you  said turnbull   but you say everything tail foremost .', ' she wants us to do it  said evan  in a voice crushed with passion .', ' she has hurt herself so that we might do it .', 'she has left her good name and her good sleep and all her habits and dignity flung away on the other side of england in the hope that she may hear of us and that we have broken some hole into heaven .', ' i thought i knew what you mean  said turnbull  biting his beard   it does seem as if we ought to do something after all she has done this night .', ' i never liked you so much before  said macian  in bitter sorrow .', 'as he spoke  three solemn footmen came out of the lodge gate and assembled to assist the chauffeur to his room .', 'the mere sight of them made the two wanderers flee as from a too frightful incongruity  and before they knew where they were  they were well upon the grassy ledge of england that overlooks the channel .', 'evan said suddenly   will they let me see her in heaven once in a thousand ages ', 'and addressed the remark to the editor of the atheist  as on which he would be likely or qualified to answer .', 'but no answer came  a silence sank between the two .', 'turnbull strode sturdily to the edge of the cliff and looked out  his companion following  somewhat more shaken by his recent agitation .', ' if that  s the view you take  said turnbull   and i don  t say you are wrong  i think i know where we shall be best off for the business .', 'as it happens  i know this part of the south coast pretty well .', 'and unless i am mistaken there  s a way down the cliff just here which will land us on a stretch of firm sand where no one is likely to follow us .', 'the highlander made a gesture of assent and came also almost to the edge of the precipice .', 'the sunrise  which was broadening over sea and shore  was one of those rare and splendid ones in which there seems to be no mist or doubt  and nothing but a universal clarification more and more complete .', 'all the colours were transparent .', 'it seemed like a triumphant prophecy of some perfect world where everything being innocent will be intelligible  a world where even our bodies  so to speak  may be as of burning glass .', 'such a world is faintly though fiercely figured in the coloured windows of christian architecture .', 'the sea that lay before them was like a pavement of emerald  bright and almost brittle  the sky against which its strict horizon hung was almost absolutely white  except that close to the sky line  like scarlet braids on the hem of a garment  lay strings of flaky cloud of so gleaming and gorgeous a red that they seemed cut out of some strange blood  red celestial metal  of which the mere gold of this earth is but a drab yellow imitation .', ' the hand of heaven is still pointing  muttered the man of superstition to himself .', ' and now it is a blood  red hand .', 'the cool voice of his companion cut in upon his monologue  calling to him from a little farther along the cliff  to tell him that he had found the ladder of descent .', 'it began as a steep and somewhat greasy path  which then tumbled down twenty or thirty feet in the form of a fall of rough stone steps .', 'after that  there was a rather awkward drop on to a ledge of stone and then the journey was undertaken easily and even elegantly by the remains of an ornamental staircase  such as might have belonged to some long  disused watering  place .', 'all the time that the two travellers sank from stage to stage of this downward journey  there closed over their heads living bridges and caverns of the most varied foliage  all of which grew greener  redder  or more golden  in the growing sunlight of the morning .', 'life  too  of the more moving sort rose at the sun on every side of them .', 'birds whirred and fluttered in the undergrowth  as if imprisoned in green cages .', 'other birds were shaken up in great clouds from the tree  tops  as if they were blossoms detached and scattered up to heaven .', 'animals which turnbull was too much of a londoner and macian too much of a northerner to know  slipped by among the tangle or ran pattering up the tree  trunks .', 'both the men  according to their several creeds  felt the full thunder of the psalm of life as they had never heard it before  macian felt god the father  benignant in all his energies  and turnbull that ultimate anonymous energy  that natura naturans  which is the whole theme of lucretius .', 'it was down this clamorous ladder of life that they went down to die .', 'they broke out upon a brown semicircle of sand  so free from human imprint as to justify turnbull  s profession .', 'they strode out upon it  stuck their swords in the sand  and had a pause too important for speech .', 'turnbull eyed the coast curiously for a moment  like one awakening memories of childhood  then he said abruptly  like a man remembering somebody  s name   but  of course  we shall be better off still round the corner of cragness point  nobody ever comes there at all .', 'and picking up his sword again  he began striding towards a big bluff of the rocks which stood out upon their left .', 'macian followed him round the corner and found himself in what was certainly an even finer fencing court  of flat  firm sand  enclosed on three sides by white walls of rock  and on the fourth by the green wall of the advancing sea .', ' we are quite safe here  said turnbull  and  to the other  s surprise  flung himself down  sitting on the brown beach .', ' you see  i was brought up near here  he explained .', ' i was sent from scotland to stop with my aunt .', 'it is highly probable that i may die here .', 'do you mind if i light a pipe ', ' of course  do whatever you like  said macian  with a choking voice  and he went and walked alone by himself along the wet  glistening sands .', 'ten minutes afterwards he came back again  white with his own whirlwind of emotions  turnbull was quite cheerful and was knocking out the end of his pipe .', ' you see  we have to do it  said macian .', ' she tied us to it .', ' of course  my dear fellow  said the other  and leapt up as lightly as a monkey .', 'they took their places gravely in the very centre of the great square of sand  as if they had thousands of spectators .', 'before saluting  macian  who  being a mystic  was one inch nearer to nature  cast his eye round the huge framework of their heroic folly .', 'the three walls of rock all leant a little outward  though at various angles  but this impression was exaggerated in the direction of the incredible by the heavy load of living trees and thickets which each wall wore on its top like a huge shock of hair .', 'on all that luxurious crest of life the risen and victorious sun was beating  burnishing it all like gold  and every bird that rose with that sunrise caught a light like a star upon it like the dove of the holy spirit .', 'imaginative life had never so much crowded upon macian .', 'he felt that he could write whole books about the feelings of a single bird .', 'he felt that for two centuries he would not tire of being a rabbit .', 'he was in the palace of life  of which the very tapestries and curtains were alive .', 'then he recovered himself  and remembered his affairs .', 'both men saluted  and iron rang upon iron .', 'it was exactly at the same moment that he realized that his enemy  s left ankle was encircled with a ring of salt water that had crept up to his feet .', ' what is the matter ', 'said turnbull  stopping an instant  for he had grown used to every movement of his extraordinary fellow  traveller  s face .', 'macian glanced again at that silver anklet of sea  water and then looked beyond at the next promontory round which a deep sea was boiling and leaping .', 'then he turned and looked back and saw heavy foam being shaken up to heaven about the base of cragness point .', ' the sea has cut us off  he said  curtly .', ' i have noticed it  said turnbull with equal sobriety .', ' what view do you take of the development ', 'evan threw away his weapon  and  as his custom was  imprisoned his big head in his hands .', 'then he let them fall and said   yes  i know what it means  and i think it is the fairest thing .', 'it is the finger of god  red as blood  still pointing .', 'but now it points to two graves .', 'there was a space filled with the sound of the sea  and then macian spoke again in a voice pathetically reasonable   you see  we both saved her  and she told us both to fight  and it would not be just that either should fail and fall alone  while the other ', ' you mean  said turnbull  in a voice surprisingly soft and gentle   that there is something fine about fighting in a place where even the conqueror must die ', ' oh  you have got it right  you have got it right ', 'cried out evan  in an extraordinary childish ecstasy .', ' oh  i  m sure that you really believe in god ', 'turnbull answered not a word  but only took up his fallen sword .', 'for the third time evan macian looked at those three sides of english cliff hung with their noisy load of life .', 'he had been at a loss to understand the almost ironical magnificence of all those teeming creatures and tropical colours and smells that smoked happily to heaven .', 'but now he knew that he was in the closed court of death and that all the gates were sealed .', 'he drank in the last green and the last red and the last gold  those unique and indescribable things of god  as a man drains good wine at the bottom of his glass .', 'then he turned and saluted his enemy once more  and the two stood up and fought till the foam flowed over their knees .', 'then macian stepped backward suddenly with a splash and held up his hand .', ' turnbull ', 'he cried   i can  t help it  fair fighting is more even than promises .', 'and this is not fair fighting .', ' what the deuce do you mean ', 'asked the other  staring .', ' i  ve only just thought of it  cried evan  brokenly .', ' we  re very well matched  it may go on a good time  the tide is coming up fast  and i  m a foot and a half taller .', 'you  ll be washed away like seaweed before it  s above my breeches .', 'i  ll not fight foul for all the girls and angels in the universe .', ' will you oblige me  said turnbull  with staring grey eyes and a voice of distinct and violent politeness   will you oblige me by jolly well minding your own business ', 'just you stand up and fight  and we  ll see who will be washed away like seaweed .', 'you wanted to finish this fight and you shall finish it  or i  ll denounce you as a coward to the whole of that assembled company .', 'evan looked very doubtful and offered a somewhat wavering weapon  but he was quickly brought back to his senses by his opponent  s sword  point  which shot past him  shaving his shoulder by a hair .', 'by this time the waves were well up turnbull  s thigh  and what was worse  they were beginning to roll and break heavily around them .', 'macian parried this first lunge perfectly  the next less perfectly  the third in all human probability he would not have parried at all  the christian champion would have been pinned like a butterfly  and the atheistic champion left to drown like a rat  with such consolation as his view of the cosmos afforded him .', 'but just as turnbull launched his heaviest stroke  the sea  in which he stood up to his hips  launched a yet heavier one .', 'a wave breaking beyond the others smote him heavily like a hammer of water .', 'one leg gave way  he was swung round and sucked into the retreating sea  still gripping his sword .', 'macian put his sword between his teeth and plunged after his disappearing enemy .', 'he had the sense of having the whole universe on top of him as crest after crest struck him down .', 'it seemed to him quite a cosmic collapse  as if all the seven heavens were falling on him one after the other .', 'but he got hold of the atheist  s left leg and he did not let it go .', 'after some ten minutes of foam and frenzy  in which all the senses at once seemed blasted by the sea  evan found himself laboriously swimming on a low  green swell  with the sword still in his teeth and the editor of the atheist still under his arm .', 'what he was going to do he had not even the most glimmering idea  so he merely kept his grip and swam somehow with one hand .', 'he ducked instinctively as there bulked above him a big  black wave  much higher than any that he had seen .', 'then he saw that it was hardly the shape of any possible wave .', 'then he saw that it was a fisherman  s boat  and  leaping upward  caught hold of the bow .', 'the boat pitched forward with its stern in the air for just as much time as was needed to see that there was nobody in it .', 'after a moment or two of desperate clambering  however  there were two people in it  mr . evan macian  panting and sweating  and mr . james turnbull  uncommonly close to being drowned .', 'after ten minutes  aimless tossing in the empty fishing  boat he recovered  however  stirred  stretched himself  and looked round on the rolling waters .', 'then  while taking no notice of the streams of salt water that were pouring from his hair  beard  coat  boots  and trousers  he carefully wiped the wet off his sword  blade to preserve it from the possibilities of rust .', 'macian found two oars in the bottom of the deserted boat and began somewhat drearily to row .', '  ', 'a rainy twilight was clearing to cold silver over the moaning sea  when the battered boat that had rolled and drifted almost aimlessly all night  came within sight of land  though of land which looked almost as lost and savage as the waves .', 'all night there had been but little lifting in the leaden sea  only now and then the boat had been heaved up  as on a huge shoulder which slipped from under it  such occasional sea  quakes came probably from the swell of some steamer that had passed it in the dark  otherwise the waves were harmless though restless .', 'but it was piercingly cold  and there was  from time to time  a splutter of rain like the splutter of the spray  which seemed almost to freeze as it fell .', 'macian  more at home than his companion in this quite barbarous and elemental sort of adventure  had rowed toilsomely with the heavy oars whenever he saw anything that looked like land  but for the most part had trusted with grim transcendentalism to wind and tide .', 'among the implements of their first outfit the brandy alone had remained to him  and he gave it to his freezing companion in quantities which greatly alarmed that temperate londoner  but macian came from the cold seas and mists where a man can drink a tumbler of raw whisky in a boat without it making him wink .', 'when the highlander began to pull really hard upon the oars  turnbull craned his dripping red head out of the boat to see the goal of his exertions .', 'it was a sufficiently uninviting one  nothing so far as could be seen but a steep and shelving bank of shingle  made of loose little pebbles such as children like  but slanting up higher than a house .', 'on the top of the mound  against the sky line  stood up the brown skeleton of some broken fence or breakwater .', 'with the grey and watery dawn crawling up behind it  the fence really seemed to say to our philosophic adventurers that they had come at last to the other end of nowhere .', 'bent by necessity to his labour  macian managed the heavy boat with real power and skill  and when at length he ran it up on a smoother part of the slope it caught and held so that they could clamber out  not sinking farther than their knees into the water and the shingle .', 'a foot or two farther up their feet found the beach firmer  and a few moments afterwards they were leaning on the ragged breakwater and looking back at the sea they had escaped .', 'they had a dreary walk across wastes of grey shingle in the grey dawn before they began to come within hail of human fields or roads  nor had they any notion of what fields or roads they would be .', 'their boots were beginning to break up and the confusion of stones tried them severely  so that they were glad to lean on their swords  as if they were the staves of pilgrims .', 'macian thought vaguely of a weird ballad of his own country which describes the soul in purgatory as walking on a plain full of sharp stones  and only saved by its own charities upon earth .', 'if ever thou gavest hosen and shoon every night and all  sit thee down and put them on  and christ receive thy soul .', 'turnbull had no such lyrical meditations  but he was in an even worse temper .', 'at length they came to a pale ribbon of road  edged by a shelf of rough and almost colourless turf  and a few feet up the slope there stood grey and weather  stained  one of those big wayside crucifixes which are seldom seen except in catholic countries .', 'macian put his hand to his head and found that his bonnet was not there .', 'turnbull gave one glance at the crucifix  a glance at once sympathetic and bitter  in which was concentrated the whole of swinburne  s poem on the same occasion .', 'o hidden face of man  whereover the years have woven a viewless veil  if thou wert verily man  s lover what did thy love or blood avail ', 'thy blood the priests mix poison of  and in gold shekels coin thy love .', 'then  leaving macian in his attitude of prayer  turnbull began to look right and left very sharply  like one looking for something .', 'suddenly  with a little cry  he saw it and ran forward .', 'a few yards from them along the road a lean and starved sort of hedge came pitifully to an end .', 'caught upon its prickly angle  however  there was a very small and very dirty scrap of paper that might have hung there for months  since it escaped from someone tearing up a letter or making a spill out of a newspaper .', 'turnbull snatched at it and found it was the corner of a printed page  very coarsely printed  like a cheap novelette  and just large enough to contain the words   et c  est elle qui ', ' hurrah ', 'cried turnbull  waving his fragment   we are safe at last .', 'we are free at last .', 'we are somewhere better than england or eden or paradise .', 'macian  we are in the land of the duel ', ' where do you say ', 'said the other  looking at him heavily and with knitted brows  like one almost dazed with the grey doubts of desolate twilight and drifting sea .', ' we are in france ', 'cried turnbull  with a voice like a trumpet   in the land where things really happen  tout arrive en france .', 'we arrive in france .', 'look at this little message  and he held out the scrap of paper .', ' there  s an omen for you superstitious hill folk .', 'c  est elle qui  mais oui  mais oui  c  est elle qui sauvera encore le monde .', ' france ', 'repeated macian  and his eyes awoke again in his head like large lamps lighted .', ' yes  france ', 'said turnbull  and all the rhetorical part of him came to the top  his face growing as red as his hair .', ' france  that has always been in rebellion for liberty and reason .', 'france  that has always assailed superstition with the club of rabelais or the rapier of voltaire .', 'france  at whose first council table sits the sublime figure of julian the apostate .', 'france  where a man said only the other day those splendid unanswerable words  with a superb gesture  we have extinguished in heaven those lights that men shall never light again .', ' no  said macian  in a voice that shook with a controlled passion .', ' but france  which was taught by st . bernard and led to war by joan of arc .', 'france that made the crusades .', 'france that saved the church and scattered the heresies by the mouths of bossuet and massillon .', 'france  which shows today the conquering march of catholicism  as brain after brain surrenders to it  brunetire  coppe  hauptmann  barrs  bourget  lematre .', ' france ', 'asserted turnbull with a sort of rollicking self  exaggeration  very unusual with him   france  which is one torrent of splendid scepticism from abelard to anatole france .', ' france  said macian   which is one cataract of clear faith from st . louis to our lady of lourdes .', ' france at least  cried turnbull  throwing up his sword in schoolboy triumph   in which these things are thought about and fought about .', 'france  where reason and religion clash in one continual tournament .', 'france  above all  where men understand the pride and passion which have plucked our blades from their scabbards .', 'here  at least  we shall not be chased and spied on by sickly parsons and greasy policemen  because we wish to put our lives on the game .', 'courage  my friend  we have come to the country of honour .', 'macian did not even notice the incongruous phrase  my friend  but nodding again and again  drew his sword and flung the scabbard far behind him in the road .', ' yes  he cried  in a voice of thunder   we will fight here and he shall look on at it .', 'turnbull glanced at the crucifix with a sort of scowling good  humour and then said   he may look and see his cross defeated .', ' the cross cannot be defeated  said macian   for it is defeat .', 'a second afterwards the two bright  blood  thirsty weapons made the sign of the cross in horrible parody upon each other .', 'they had not touched each other twice  however  when upon the hill  above the crucifix  there appeared another horrible parody of its shape  the figure of a man who appeared for an instant waving his outspread arms .', 'he had vanished in an instant  but macian  whose fighting face was set that way  had seen the shape momentarily but quite photographically .', 'and while it was like a comic repetition of the cross  it was also  in that place and hour  something more incredible .', 'it had been only instantaneously on the retina of his eye  but unless his eye and mind were going mad together  the figure was that of an ordinary london policeman .', 'he tried to concentrate his senses on the sword  play  but one half of his brain was wrestling with the puzzle  the apocalyptic and almost seraphic apparition of a stout constable out of clapham on top of a dreary and deserted hill in france .', 'he did not  however  have to puzzle long .', 'before the duellists had exchanged half a dozen passes  the big  blue policeman appeared once more on the top of the hill  a palpable monstrosity in the eye of heaven .', 'he was waving only one arm now and seemed to be shouting directions .', 'at the same moment a mass of blue blocked the corner of the road behind the small  smart figure of turnbull  and a small company of policemen in the english uniform came up at a kind of half  military double .', 'turnbull saw the stare of consternation in his enemy  s face and swung round to share its cause .', 'when he saw it  cool as he was  he staggered back .', ' what the devil are you doing here ', 'he called out in a high  shrill voice of authority  like one who finds a tramp in his own larder .', ' well  sir  said the sergeant in command  with that sort of heavy civility shown only to the evidently guilty   seems to me we might ask what are you doing here ', ' we are having an affair of honour  said turnbull  as if it were the most rational thing in the world .', ' if the french police like to interfere  let them interfere .', 'but why the blue blazes should you interfere  you great blue blundering sausages ', ' i  m afraid  sir  said the sergeant with restraint   i  m afraid i don  t quite follow you .', ' i mean  why don  t the french police take this up if it  s got to be taken up ', 'i always heard that they were spry enough in their own way .', ' well  sir  said the sergeant reflectively   you see  sir  the french police don  t take this up  well  because you see  sir  this ain  t france .', 'this is his majesty  s dominions  same as  ampstead  eath .', ' not france ', 'repeated turnbull  with a sort of dull incredulity .', ' no  sir  said the sergeant   though most of the people talk french .', 'this is the island called st . loup  sir  an island in the channel .', 'we  ve been sent down specially from london  as you were such specially distinguished criminals  if you  ll allow me to say so .', 'which reminds me to warn you that anything you say may be used against you at your trial .', ' quite so  said turnbull  and lurched suddenly against the sergeant  so as to tip him over the edge of the road with a crash into the shingle below .', 'then leaving macian and the policemen equally and instantaneously nailed to the road  he ran a little way along it  leapt off on to a part of the beach  which he had found in his journey to be firmer  and went across it with a clatter of pebbles .', 'his sudden calculation was successful  the police  unacquainted with the various levels of the loose beach  tried to overtake him by the shorter cut and found themselves  being heavy men  almost up to their knees in shoals of slippery shingle .', 'two who had been slower with their bodies were quicker with their minds  and seeing turnbull  s trick  ran along the edge of the road after him .', 'then macian finally awoke  and leaving half his sleeve in the grip of the only man who tried to hold him  took the two policemen in the small of their backs with the impetus of a cannon  ball and  sending them also flat among the stones  went tearing after his twin defier of the law .', 'as they were both good runners  the start they had gained was decisive .', 'they dropped over a high breakwater farther on upon the beach  turned sharply  and scrambled up a line of ribbed rocks  crowned with a thicket  crawled through it  scratching their hands and faces  and dropped into another road  and there found that they could slacken their speed into a steady trot .', 'in all this desperate dart and scramble  they still kept hold of their drawn swords  which now  indeed  in the vigorous phrase of bunyan  seemed almost to grow out of their hands .', 'they had run another half mile or so when it became apparent that they were entering a sort of scattered village .', 'one or two whitewashed cottages and even a shop had appeared along the side of the road .', 'then  for the first time  turnbull twisted round his red bear to get a glimpse of his companion  who was a foot or two behind  and remarked abruptly   mr . macian  we  ve been going the wrong way to work all along .', 'we  re traced everywhere  because everybody knows about us .', 'it  s as if one went about with kruger  s beard on mafeking night .', ' what do you mean ', 'said macian  innocently .', ' i mean  said turnbull  with steady conviction   that what we want is a little diplomacy  and i am going to buy some in a shop .', 'xi .', 'a scandal in the village', 'in the little hamlet of haroc  in the isle of st . loup  there lived a man who  though living under the english flag  was absolutely untypical of the french tradition .', 'he was quite unnoticeable  but that was exactly where he was quite himself .', 'he was not even extraordinarily french  but then it is against the french tradition to be extraordinarily french .', 'ordinary englishmen would only have thought him a little old  fashioned  imperialistic englishmen would really have mistaken him for the old john bull of the caricatures .', 'he was stout  he was quite undistinguished  and he had side  whiskers  worn just a little longer than john bull  s .', 'he was by name pierre durand  he was by trade a wine merchant  he was by politics a conservative republican  he had been brought up a catholic  had always thought and acted as an agnostic  and was very mildly returning to the church in his later years .', 'he had a genius  if one can even use so wild a word in connexion with so tame a person  a genius for saying the conventional thing on every conceivable subject  or rather what we in england would call the conventional thing .', 'for it was not convention with him  but solid and manly conviction .', 'convention implies cant or affectation  and he had not the faintest smell of either .', 'he was simply an ordinary citizen with ordinary views  and if you had told him so he would have taken it as an ordinary compliment .', 'if you had asked him about women  he would have said that one must preserve their domesticity and decorum  he would have used the stalest words  but he would have in reserve the strongest arguments .', 'if you had asked him about government  he would have said that all citizens were free and equal  but he would have meant what he said .', 'if you had asked him about education  he would have said that the young must be trained up in habits of industry and of respect for their parents .', 'still he would have set them the example of industry  and he would have been one of the parents whom they could respect .', 'a state of mind so hopelessly central is depressing to the english instinct .', 'but then in england a man announcing these platitudes is generally a fool and a frightened fool  announcing them out of mere social servility .', 'but durand was anything but a fool  he had read all the eighteenth century  and could have defended his platitudes round every angle of eighteenth  century argument .', 'and certainly he was anything but a coward  swollen and sedentary as he was  he could have hit any man back who touched him with the instant violence of an automatic machine  and dying in a uniform would have seemed to him only the sort of thing that sometimes happens .', 'i am afraid it is impossible to explain this monster amid the exaggerative sects and the eccentric clubs of my country .', 'he was merely a man .', 'he lived in a little villa which was furnished well with comfortable chairs and tables and highly uncomfortable classical pictures and medallions .', 'the art in his home contained nothing between the two extremes of hard  meagre designs of greek heads and roman togas  and on the other side a few very vulgar catholic images in the crudest colours  these were mostly in his daughter  s room .', 'he had recently lost his wife  whom he had loved heartily and rather heavily in complete silence  and upon whose grave he was constantly in the habit of placing hideous little wreaths  made out of a sort of black  and  white beads .', 'to his only daughter he was equally devoted  though he restricted her a good deal under a sort of theoretic alarm about her innocence  an alarm which was peculiarly unnecessary  first  because she was an exceptionally reticent and religious girl  and secondly  because there was hardly anybody else in the place .', 'madeleine durand was physically a sleepy young woman  and might easily have been supposed to be morally a lazy one .', 'it is  however  certain that the work of her house was done somehow  and it is even more rapidly ascertainable that nobody else did it .', 'the logician is  therefore  driven back upon the assumption that she did it  and that lends a sort of mysterious interest to her personality at the beginning .', 'she had very broad  low  and level brows  which seemed even lower because her warm yellow hair clustered down to her eyebrows  and she had a face just plump enough not to look as powerful as it was .', 'anything that was heavy in all this was abruptly lightened by two large  light china  blue eyes  lightened all of a sudden as if it had been lifted into the air by two big blue butterflies .', 'the rest of her was less than middle  sized  and was of a casual and comfortable sort  and she had this difference from such girls as the girl in the motor  car  that one did not incline to take in her figure at all  but only her broad and leonine and innocent head .', 'both the father and the daughter were of the sort that would normally have avoided all observation  that is  all observation in that extraordinary modern world which calls out everything except strength .', 'both of them had strength below the surface  they were like quiet peasants owning enormous and unquarried mines .', 'the father with his square face and grey side whiskers  the daughter with her square face and golden fringe of hair  were both stronger than they know  stronger than anyone knew .', 'the father believed in civilization  in the storied tower we have erected to affront nature  that is  the father believed in man .', 'the daughter believed in god  and was even stronger .', 'they neither of them believed in themselves  for that is a decadent weakness .', 'the daughter was called a devotee .', 'she left upon ordinary people the impression  the somewhat irritating impression  produced by such a person  it can only be described as the sense of strong water being perpetually poured into some abyss .', 'she did her housework easily  she achieved her social relations sweetly  she was never neglectful and never unkind .', 'this accounted for all that was soft in her  but not for all that was hard .', 'she trod firmly as if going somewhere  she flung her face back as if defying something  she hardly spoke a cross word  yet there was often battle in her eyes .', 'the modern man asked doubtfully where all this silent energy went to .', 'he would have stared still more doubtfully if he had been told that it all went into her prayers .', 'the conventions of the isle of st . loup were necessarily a compromise or confusion between those of france and england  and it was vaguely possible for a respectable young lady to have half  attached lovers  in a way that would be impossible to the bourgeoisie of france .', 'one man in particular had made himself an unmistakable figure in the track of this girl as she went to church .', 'he was a short  prosperous  looking man  whose long  bushy black beard and clumsy black umbrella made him seem both shorter and older than he really was  but whose big  bold eyes  and step that spurned the ground  gave him an instant character of youth .', 'his name was camille bert  and he was a commercial traveller who had only been in the island an idle week before he began to hover in the tracks of madeleine durand .', 'since everyone knows everyone in so small a place  madeleine certainly knew him to speak to  but it is not very evident that she ever spoke .', 'he haunted her  however  especially at church  which was  indeed  one of the few certain places for finding her .', 'in her home she had a habit of being invisible  sometimes through insatiable domesticity  sometimes through an equally insatiable solitude .', 'm . bert did not give the impression of a pious man  though he did give  especially with his eyes  the impression of an honest one .', 'but he went to mass with a simple exactitude that could not be mistaken for a pose  or even for a vulgar fascination .', 'it was perhaps this religious regularity which eventually drew madeleine into recognition of him .', 'at least it is certain that she twice spoke to him with her square and open smile in the porch of the church  and there was human nature enough in the hamlet to turn even that into gossip .', 'but the real interest arose suddenly as a squall arises with the extraordinary affair that occurred about five days after .', 'there was about a third of a mile beyond the village of haroc a large but lonely hotel upon the london or paris model  but commonly almost entirely empty .', 'among the accidental group of guests who had come to it at this season was a man whose nationality no one could fix and who bore the non  committal name of count gregory .', 'he treated everybody with complete civility and almost in complete silence .', 'on the few occasions when he spoke  he spoke either french  english  or once  to the priest  latin  and the general opinion was that he spoke them all wrong .', 'he was a large  lean man  with the stoop of an aged eagle  and even the eagle  s nose to complete it  he had old  fashioned military whiskers and moustache dyed with a garish and highly incredible yellow .', 'he had the dress of a showy gentleman and the manners of a decayed gentleman  he seemed  as with a sort of simplicity  to be trying to be a dandy when he was too old even to know that he was old .', 'ye he was decidedly a handsome figure with his curled yellow hair and lean fastidious face  and he wore a peculiar frock  coat of bright turquoise blue  with an unknown order pinned to it  and he carried a huge and heavy cane .', 'despite his silence and his dandified dress and whiskers  the island might never have heard of him but for the extraordinary event of which i have spoken  which fell about in the following way ', 'in such casual atmospheres only the enthusiastic go to benediction  and as the warm blue twilight closed over the little candle  lit church and village  the line of worshippers who went home from the former to the latter thinned out until it broke .', 'on one such evening at least no one was in church except the quiet  unconquerable madeleine  four old women  one fisherman  and  of course  the irrepressible m . camille bert .', 'the others seemed to melt away afterwards into the peacock colours of the dim green grass and the dark blue sky .', 'even durand was invisible instead of being merely reverentially remote  and madeleine set forth through the patch of black forest alone .', 'she was not in the least afraid of loneliness  because she was not afraid of devils .', 'i think they were afraid of her .', 'in a clearing of the wood  however  which was lit up with a last patch of the perishing sunlight  there advanced upon her suddenly one who was more startling than a devil .', 'the incomprehensible count gregory  with his yellow hair like flame and his face like the white ashes of the flame  was advancing bareheaded towards her  flinging out his arms and his long fingers with a frantic gesture .', ' we are alone here  he cried   and you would be at my mercy  only that i am at yours .', 'then his frantic hands fell by his sides and he looked up under his brows with an expression that went well with his hard breathing .', 'madeleine durand had come to a halt at first in childish wonder  and now  with more than masculine self  control   i fancy i know your face  sir  she said  as if to gain time .', ' i know i shall not forget yours  said the other  and extended once more his ungainly arms in an unnatural gesture .', 'then of a sudden there came out of him a spout of wild and yet pompous phrases .', ' it is as well that you should know the worst and the best .', 'i am a man who knows no limit  i am the most callous of criminals  the most unrepentant of sinners .', 'there is no man in my dominions so vile as i .', 'but my dominions stretch from the olives of italy to the fir  woods of denmark  and there is no nook of all of them in which i have not done a sin .', 'but when i bear you away i shall be doing my first sacrilege  and also my first act of virtue .', 'he seized her suddenly by the elbow  and she did not scream but only pulled and tugged .', 'yet though she had not screamed  someone astray in the woods seemed to have heard the struggle .', 'a short but nimble figure came along the woodland path like a humming bullet and had caught count gregory a crack across the face before his own could be recognized .', 'when it was recognized it was that of camille  with the black elderly beard and the young ardent eyes .', 'up to the moment when camille had hit the count  madeleine had entertained no doubt that the count was merely a madman .', 'now she was startled with a new sanity  for the tall man in the yellow whiskers and yellow moustache first returned the blow of bert  as if it were a sort of duty  and then stepped back with a slight bow and an easy smile .', ' this need go no further here  m . bert  he said .', ' i need not remind you how far it should go elsewhere .', ' certainly  you need remind me of nothing  answered camille  stolidly .', ' i am glad that you are just not too much of a scoundrel for a gentleman to fight .', ' we are detaining the lady  said count gregory  with politeness  and  making a gesture suggesting that he would have taken off his hat if he had had one  he strode away up the avenue of trees and eventually disappeared .', 'he was so complete an aristocrat that he could offer his back to them all the way up that avenue  and his back never once looked uncomfortable .', ' you must allow me to see you home  said bert to the girl  in a gruff and almost stifled voice   i think we have only a little way to go .', ' only a little way  she said  and smiled once more that night  in spite of fatigue and fear and the world and the flesh and the devil .', 'the glowing and transparent blue of twilight had long been covered by the opaque and slatelike blue of night  when he handed her into the lamp  lit interior of her home .', 'he went out himself into the darkness  walking sturdily  but tearing at his black beard .', 'all the french or semi  french gentry of the district considered this a case in which a duel was natural and inevitable  and neither party had any difficulty in finding seconds  strangers as they were in the place .', 'two small landowners  who were careful  practising catholics  willingly undertook to represent that strict church  goer camille burt  while the profligate but apparently powerful count gregory found friends in an energetic local doctor who was ready for social promotion and an accidental californian tourist who was ready for anything .', 'as no particular purpose could be served by delay  it was arranged that the affair should fall out three days afterwards .', 'and when this was settled the whole community  as it were  turned over again in bed and thought no more about the matter .', 'at least there was only one member of it who seemed to be restless  and that was she who was commonly most restful .', 'on the next night madeleine durand went to church as usual  and as usual the stricken camille was there also .', 'what was not so usual was that when they were a bow  shot from the church madeleine turned round and walked back to him .', ' sir  she began   it is not wrong of me to speak to you  and the very words gave him a jar of unexpected truth  for in all the novels he had ever read she would have begun   it is wrong of me to speak to you .', 'she went on with wide and serious eyes like an animal  s   it is not wrong of me to speak to you  because your soul  or anybody  s soul  matters so much more than what the world says about anybody .', 'i want to talk to you about what you are going to do .', 'bert saw in front of him the inevitable heroine of the novels trying to prevent bloodshed  and his pale firm face became implacable .', ' i would do anything but that for you  he said   but no man can be called less than a man .', 'she looked at him for a moment with a face openly puzzled  and then broke into an odd and beautiful half  smile .', ' oh  i don  t mean that  she said   i don  t talk about what i don  t understand .', 'no one has ever hit me  and if they had i should not feel as a man may .', 'i am sure it is not the best thing to fight .', 'it would be better to forgive  if one could really forgive .', 'but when people dine with my father and say that fighting a duel is mere murder  of course i can see that is not just .', 'it  s all so different  having a reason  and letting the other man know  and using the same guns and things  and doing it in front of your friends .', 'i  m awfully stupid  but i know that men like you aren  t murderers .', 'but it wasn  t that that i meant .', ' what did you mean ', 'asked the other  looking broodingly at the earth .', ' don  t you know  she said   there is only one more celebration ', 'i thought that as you always go to church  i thought you would communicate this morning .', 'bert stepped backward with a sort of action she had never seen in him before .', 'it seemed to alter his whole body .', ' you may be right or wrong to risk dying  said the girl  simply   the poor women in our village risk it whenever they have a baby .', 'you men are the other half of the world .', 'i know nothing about when you ought to die .', 'but surely if you are daring to try and find god beyond the grave and appeal to him  you ought to let him find you when he comes and stands there every morning in our little church .', 'and placid as she was  she made a little gesture of argument  of which the pathos wrung the heart .', 'm . camille bert was by no means placid .', 'before that incomplete gesture and frankly pleading face he retreated as if from the jaws of a dragon .', 'his dark black hair and beard looked utterly unnatural against the startling pallor of his face .', 'when at last he said something it was   o god ', 'i can  t stand this ', 'he did not say it in french .', 'nor did he  strictly speaking  say it in english .', 'the truth  interesting only to anthropologists  is that he said it in scotch .', ' there will be another mass in a matter of eight hours  said madeleine  with a sort of business eagerness and energy   and you can do it then before the fighting .', 'you must forgive me  but i was so frightened that you would not do it at all .', 'bert seemed to crush his teeth together until they broke  and managed to say between them   and why should you suppose that i shouldn  t do as you say  i mean not to do it at all ', ' you always go to mass  answered the girl  opening her wide blue eyes   and the mass is very long and tiresome unless one loves god .', 'then it was that bert exploded with a brutality which might have come from count gregory  his criminal opponent .', 'he advanced upon madeleine with flaming eyes  and almost took her by the two shoulders .', ' i do not love god  he cried  speaking french with the broadest scotch accent   i do not want to find him  i do not think he is there to be found .', 'i must burst up the show  i must and will say everything .', 'you are the happiest and honestest thing i ever saw in this godless universe .', 'and i am the dirtiest and most dishonest .', 'madeleine looked at him doubtfully for an instant  and then said with a sudden simplicity and cheerfulness   oh  but if you are really sorry it is all right .', 'if you are horribly sorry it is all the better .', 'you have only to go and tell the priest so and he will give you god out of his own hands .', ' i hate your priest and i deny your god ', 'cried the man   and i tell you god is a lie and a fable and a mask .', 'and for the first time in my life i do not feel superior to god .', ' what can it all mean ', 'said madeleine  in massive wonder .', ' because i am a fable also and a mask  said the man .', 'he had been plucking fiercely at his black beard and hair all the time  now he suddenly plucked them off and flung them like moulted feathers in the mire .', 'this extraordinary spoliation left in the sunlight the same face  but a much younger head  a head with close chestnut curls and a short chestnut beard .', ' now you know the truth  he answered  with hard eyes .', ' i am a cad who has played a crooked trick on a quiet village and a decent woman for a private reason of his own .', 'i might have played it successfully on any other woman  i have hit the one woman on whom it cannot be played .', 'it  s just like my damned luck .', 'the plain truth is  and here when he came to the plain truth he boggled and blundered as evan had done in telling it to the girl in the motor  car .', ' the plain truth is  he said at last   that i am james turnbull the atheist .', 'the police are after me  not for atheism but for being ready to fight for it .', ' i saw something about you in a newspaper  said the girl  with a simplicity which even surprise could never throw off its balance .', ' evan macian said there was a god  went on the other  stubbornly   and i say there isn  t .', 'and i have come to fight for the fact that there is no god  it is for that that i have seen this cursed island and your blessed face .', ' you want me really to believe  said madeleine  with parted lips   that you think ', ' i want you to hate me ', 'cried turnbull  in agony .', ' i want you to be sick when you think of my name .', 'i am sure there is no god .', ' but there is  said madeleine  quite quietly  and rather with the air of one telling children about an elephant .', ' why  i touched his body only this morning .', ' you touched a bit of bread  said turnbull  biting his knuckles .', ' oh  i will say anything that can madden you ', ' you think it is only a bit of bread  said the girl  and her lips tightened ever so little .', ' i know it is only a bit of bread  said turnbull  with violence .', 'she flung back her open face and smiled .', ' then why did you refuse to eat it ', 'she said .', 'james turnbull made a little step backward  and for the first time in his life there seemed to break out and blaze in his head thoughts that were not his own .', ' why  how silly of them  cried out madeleine  with quite a schoolgirl gaiety   why  how silly of them to call you a blasphemer ', 'why  you have wrecked your whole business because you would not commit blasphemy .', 'the man stood  a somewhat comic figure in his tragic bewilderment  with the honest red head of james turnbull sticking out of the rich and fictitious garments of camille bert .', 'but the startled pain of his face was strong enough to obliterate the oddity .', ' you come down here  continued the lady  with that female emphasis which is so pulverizing in conversation and so feeble at a public meeting   you and your macian come down here and put on false beards or noses in order to fight .', 'you pretend to be a catholic commercial traveller from france .', 'poor mr . macian has to pretend to be a dissolute nobleman from nowhere .', 'your scheme succeeds  you pick a quite convincing quarrel  you arrange a quite respectable duel  the duel you have planned so long will come off tomorrow with absolute certainty and safety .', 'and then you throw off your wig and throw up your scheme and throw over your colleague  because i ask you to go into a building and eat a bit of bread .', 'and then you dare to tell me that you are sure there is nothing watching us .', 'then you say you know there is nothing on the very altar you run away from .', 'you know ', ' i only know  said turnbull   that i must run away from you .', 'this has got beyond any talking .', 'and he plunged along into the village  leaving his black wig and beard lying behind him on the road .', 'as the market  place opened before him he saw count gregory  that distinguished foreigner  standing and smoking in elegant meditation at the corner of the local caf .', 'he immediately made his way rapidly towards him  considering that a consultation was urgent .', 'but he had hardly crossed half of that stony quadrangle when a window burst open above him and a head was thrust out  shouting .', 'the man was in his woollen undershirt  but turnbull knew the energetic  apologetic head of the sergeant of police .', 'he pointed furiously at turnbull and shouted his name .', 'a policeman ran excitedly from under an archway and tried to collar him .', 'two men selling vegetables dropped their baskets and joined in the chase .', 'turnbull dodged the constable  upset one of the men into his own basket  and bounding towards the distinguished foreign count  called to him clamorously   come on  macian  the hunt is up again .', 'the prompt reply of count gregory was to pull off his large yellow whiskers and scatter them on the breeze with an air of considerable relief .', 'then he joined the flight of turnbull  and even as he did so  with one wrench of his powerful hands rent and split the strange  thick stick that he carried .', 'inside it was a naked old  fashioned rapier .', 'the two got a good start up the road before the whole town was awakened behind them  and half  way up it a similar transformation was seen to take place in mr . turnbull  s singular umbrella .', 'the two had a long race for the harbour  but the english police were heavy and the french inhabitants were indifferent .', 'in any case  they got used to the notion of the road being clear  and just as they had come to the cliffs macian banged into another gentleman with unmistakable surprise .', 'how he knew he was another gentleman merely by banging into him  must remain a mystery .', 'macian was a very poor and very sober scotch gentleman .', 'the other was a very drunk and very wealthy english gentleman .', 'but there was something in the staggered and openly embarrassed apologies that made them understand each other as readily and as quickly and as much as two men talking french in the middle of china .', 'the nearest expression of the type is that it either hits or apologizes  and in this case both apologized .', ' you seem to be in a hurry  said the unknown englishman  falling back a step or two in order to laugh with an unnatural heartiness .', ' what  s it all about  eh ', 'then before macian could get past his sprawling and staggering figure he ran forward again and said with a sort of shouting and ear  shattering whisper   i say  my name is wilkinson .', 'you know  wilkinson  s entire was my grandfather .', 'can  t drink beer myself .', 'liver .', 'and he shook his head with extraordinary sagacity .', ' we really are in a hurry  as you say  said macian  summoning a sufficiently pleasant smile   so if you will let us pass ', ' i  ll tell you what  you fellows  said the sprawling gentleman  confidentially  while evan  s agonized ears heard behind him the first paces of the pursuit   if you really are  as you say  in a hurry  i know what it is to be in a hurry  lord  what a hurry i was in when we all came out of cartwright  s rooms  if you really are in a hurry  and he seemed to steady his voice into a sort of solemnity  if you are in a hurry  there  s nothing like a good yacht for a man in a hurry .', ' no doubt you  re right  said macian  and dashed past him in despair .', 'the head of the pursuing host was just showing over the top of the hill behind him .', 'turnbull had already ducked under the intoxicated gentleman  s elbow and fled far in front .', ' no  but look here  said mr . wilkinson  enthusiastically running after macian and catching him by the sleeve of his coat .', ' if you want to hurry you should take a yacht  and if  he said  with a burst of rationality  like one leaping to a further point in logic  if you want a yacht  you can have mine .', 'evan pulled up abruptly and looked back at him .', ' we are really in the devil of a hurry  he said   and if you really have a yacht  the truth is that we would give our ears for it .', ' you  ll find it in harbour  said wilkinson  struggling with his speech .', ' left side of harbour  called gibson girl  can  t think why  old fellow  i never lent it you before .', 'with these words the benevolent mr . wilkinson fell flat on his face in the road  but continued to laugh softly  and turned towards his flying companion a face of peculiar peace and benignity .', 'evan  s mind went through a crisis of instantaneous casuistry  in which it may be that he decided wrongly  but about how he decided his biographer can profess no doubt .', 'two minutes afterwards he had overtaken turnbull and told the tale  ten minutes afterwards he and turnbull had somehow tumbled into the yacht called the gibson girl and had somehow pushed off from the isle of st . loup .', 'xii .', 'the desert island', 'those who happen to hold the view  and mr . evan macian  now alive and comfortable  is among the number  that something supernatural  some eccentric kindness from god or fairy had guided our adventurers through all their absurd perils  might have found his strongest argument perhaps in their management or mismanagement of mr . wilkinson  s yacht .', 'neither of them had the smallest qualification for managing such a vessel  but macian had a practical knowledge of the sea in much smaller and quite different boats  while turnbull had an abstract knowledge of science and some of its applications to navigation  which was worse .', 'the presence of the god or fairy can only be deduced from the fact that they never definitely ran into anything  either a boat  a rock  a quicksand  or a man  of  war .', 'apart from this negative description  their voyage would be difficult to describe .', 'it took at least a fortnight  and macian  who was certainly the shrewder sailor of the two  realized that they were sailing west into the atlantic and were probably by this time past the scilly isles .', 'how much farther they stood out into the western sea it was impossible to conjecture .', 'but they felt certain  at least  that they were far enough into that awful gulf between us and america to make it unlikely that they would soon see land again .', 'it was therefore with legitimate excitement that one rainy morning after daybreak they saw that distinct shape of a solitary island standing up against the encircling strip of silver which ran round the skyline and separated the grey and green of the billows from the grey and mauve of the morning clouds .', ' what can it be ', 'cried macian  in a dry  throated excitement .', ' i didn  t know there were any atlantic islands so far beyond the scillies  good lord  it can  t be madeira  yet ', ' i thought you were fond of legends and lies and fables  said turnbull  grimly .', ' perhaps it  s atlantis .', ' of course  it might be  answered the other  quite innocently and gravely   but i never thought the story about atlantis was very solidly established .', ' whatever it is  we are running on to it  said turnbull  equably   and we shall be shipwrecked twice  at any rate .', 'the naked  looking nose of land projecting from the unknown island was  indeed  growing larger and larger  like the trunk of some terrible and advancing elephant .', 'there seemed to be nothing in particular  at least on this side of the island  except shoals of shellfish lying so thick as almost to make it look like one of those toy grottos that the children make .', 'in one place  however  the coast offered a soft  smooth bay of sand  and even the rudimentary ingenuity of the two amateur mariners managed to run up the little ship with her prow well on shore and her bowsprit pointing upward  as in a sort of idiotic triumph .', 'they tumbled on shore and began to unload the vessel  setting the stores out in rows upon the sand with something of the solemnity of boys playing at pirates .', 'there were mr . wilkinson  s cigar  boxes and mr . wilkinson  s dozen of champagne and mr . wilkinson  s tinned salmon and mr . wilkinson  s tinned tongue and mr . wilkinson  s tinned sardines  and every sort of preserved thing that could be seen at the army and navy stores .', 'then macian stopped with a jar of pickles in his hand and said abruptly ', ' i don  t know why we  re doing all this  i suppose we ought really to fall to and get it over .', 'then he added more thoughtfully   of course this island seems rather bare and the survivor ', ' the question is  said turnbull  with cheerful speculation   whether the survivor will be in a proper frame of mind for potted prawns .', 'macian looked down at the rows of tins and bottles  and the cloud of doubt still lowered upon his face .', ' you will permit me two liberties  my dear sir  said turnbull at last   the first is to break open this box and light one of mr . wilkinson  s excellent cigars  which will  i am sure  assist my meditations  the second is to offer a penny for your thoughts  or rather to convulse the already complex finances of this island by betting a penny that i know them .', ' what on earth are you talking about ', 'asked macian  listlessly  in the manner of an inattentive child .', ' i know what you are really thinking  macian  repeated turnbull  laughing .', ' i know what i am thinking  anyhow .', 'and i rather fancy it  s the same .', ' what are you thinking ', 'asked evan .', ' i am thinking and you are thinking  said turnbull   that it is damned silly to waste all that champagne .', 'something like the spectre of a smile appeared on the unsmiling visage of the gael  and he made at least no movement of dissent .', ' we could drink all the wine and smoke all the cigars easily in a week  said turnbull   and that would be to die feasting like heroes .', ' yes  and there is something else  said macian  with slight hesitation .', ' you see  we are on an almost unknown rock  lost in the atlantic .', 'the police will never catch us  but then neither may the public ever hear of us  and that was one of the things we wanted .', 'then  after a pause  he said  drawing in the sand with his sword  point   she may never hear of it at all .', ' well ', 'inquired the other  puffing at his cigar .', ' well  said macian   we might occupy a day or two in drawing up a thorough and complete statement of what we did and why we did it  and all about both our points of view .', 'then we could leave one copy on the island whatever happens to us and put another in an empty bottle and send it out to sea  as they do in the books .', ' a good idea  said turnbull   and now let us finish unpacking .', 'as macian  a tall  almost ghostly figure  paced along the edge of sand that ran round the islet  the purple but cloudy poetry which was his native element was piled up at its thickest upon his soul .', 'the unique island and the endless sea emphasized the thing solely as an epic .', 'there were no ladies or policemen here to give him a hint either of its farce or its tragedy .', ' perhaps when the morning stars were made  he said to himself   god built this island up from the bottom of the world to be a tower and a theatre for the fight between yea and nay .', 'then he wandered up to the highest level of the rock  where there was a roof or plateau of level stone .', 'half an hour afterwards  turnbull found him clearing away the loose sand from this table  land and making it smooth and even .', ' we will fight up here  turnbull  said macian   when the time comes .', 'and till the time comes this place shall be sacred .', ' i thought of having lunch up here  said turnbull  who had a bottle of champagne in his hand .', ' no  no  not up here  said macian  and came down from the height quite hastily .', 'before he descended  however  he fixed the two swords upright  one at each end of the platform  as if they were human sentinels to guard it under the stars .', 'then they came down and lunched plentifully in a nest of loose rocks .', 'in the same place that night they supped more plentifully still .', 'the smoke of mr . wilkinson  s cigars went up ceaseless and strong smelling  like a pagan sacrifice  the golden glories of mr . wilkinson  s champagne rose to their heads and poured out of them in fancies and philosophies .', 'and occasionally they would look up at the starlight and the rock and see the space guarded by the two cross  hilted swords  which looked like two black crosses at either end of a grave .', 'in this primitive and homeric truce the week passed by  it consisted almost entirely of eating  drinking  smoking  talking  and occasionally singing .', 'they wrote their records and cast loose their bottle .', 'they never ascended to the ominous plateau  they had never stood there save for that single embarrassed minute when they had had no time to take stock of the seascape or the shape of the land .', 'they did not even explore the island  for macian was partly concerned in prayer and turnbull entirely concerned with tobacco  and both these forms of inspiration can be enjoyed by the secluded and even the sedentary .', 'it was on a golden afternoon  the sun sinking over the sea  rayed like the very head of apollo  when turnbull tossed off the last half  pint from the emptied wilkinsonian bottle  hurled the bottle into the sea with objectless energy  and went up to where his sword stood waiting for him on the hill .', 'macian was already standing heavily by his with bent head and eyes reading the ground .', 'he had not even troubled to throw a glance round the island or the horizon .', 'but turnbull being of a more active and birdlike type of mind did throw a glance round the scene .', 'the consequence of which was that he nearly fell off the rock .', 'on three sides of this shelly and sandy islet the sea stretched blue and infinite without a speck of land or sail  the same as turnbull had first seen it  except that the tide being out it showed a few yards more of slanting sand under the roots of the rocks .', 'but on the fourth side the island exhibited a more extraordinary feature .', 'in fact  it exhibited the extraordinary feature of not being an island at all .', 'a long  curving neck of sand  as smooth and wet as the neck of the sea serpent  ran out into the sea and joined their rock to a line of low  billowing  and glistening sand  hills  which the sinking sea had just bared to the sun .', 'whether they were firm sand or quicksand it was difficult to guess  but there was at least no doubt that they lay on the edge of some larger land  for colourless hills appeared faintly behind them and no sea could be seen beyond .', ' sakes alive ', 'cried turnbull  with rolling eyes   this ain  t an island in the atlantic .', 'we  ve butted the bally continent of america .', 'macian turned his head  and his face  already pale  grew a shade paler .', 'he was by this time walking in a world of omens and hieroglyphics  and he could not read anything but what was baffling or menacing in this brown gigantic arm of the earth stretched out into the sea to seize him .', ' macian  said turnbull  in his temperate way   whatever our eternal interrupted tete  a  tetes have taught us or not taught us  at least we need not fear the charge of fear .', 'if it is essential to your emotions  i will cheerfully finish the fight here and now  but i must confess that if you kill me here i shall die with my curiosity highly excited and unsatisfied upon a minor point of geography .', ' i do not want to stop now  said the other  in his elephantine simplicity   but we must stop for a moment  because it is a sign  perhaps it is a miracle .', 'we must see what is at the end of the road of sand  it may be a bridge built across the gulf by god .', ' so long as you gratify my query  said turnbull  laughing and letting back his blade into the sheath   i do not care for what reason you choose to stop .', 'they clambered down the rocky peninsula and trudged along the sandy isthmus with the plodding resolution of men who seemed almost to have made up their minds to be wanderers on the face of the earth .', 'despite turnbull  s air of scientific eagerness  he was really the less impatient of the two  and the highlander went on well ahead of him with passionate strides .', 'by the time they had walked for about half an hour in the ups and downs of those dreary sands  the distance between the two had lengthened and macian was only a tall figure silhouetted for an instant upon the crest of some sand  dune and then disappearing behind it .', 'this rather increased the robinson crusoe feeling in mr . turnbull  and he looked about almost disconsolately for some sign of life .', 'what sort of life he expected it to be if it appeared  he did not very clearly know .', 'he has since confessed that he thinks that in his subconsciousness he expected an alligator .', 'the first sign of life that he did see  however  was something more extraordinary than the largest alligator .', 'it was nothing less than the notorious mr . evan macian coming bounding back across the sand  heaps breathless  without his cap and keeping the sword in his hand only by a habit now quite hardened .', ' take care  turnbull  he cried out from a good distance as he ran   i  ve seen a native .', ' a native ', 'repeated his companion  whose scenery had of late been chiefly of shellfish   what the deuce ', 'do you mean an oyster ', ' no  said macian  stopping and breathing hard   i mean a savage .', 'a black man .', ' why  where did you see him ', 'asked the staring editor .', ' over there  behind that hill  said the gasping macian .', ' he put up his black head and grinned at me .', 'turnbull thrust his hands through his red hair like one who gives up the world as a bad riddle .', ' lord love a duck  said he   can it be jamaica ', 'then glancing at his companion with a small frown  as of one slightly suspicious  he said   i say  don  t think me rude  but you  re a visionary kind of fellow  and then we drank a great deal .', 'do you mind waiting here while i go and see for myself ', ' shout if you get into trouble  said the celt  with composure   you will find it as i say .', 'turnbull ran off ahead with a rapidity now far greater than his rival  s  and soon vanished over the disputed sand  hill .', 'then five minutes passed  and then seven minutes  and macian bit his lip and swung his sword  and the other did not reappear .', 'finally  with a gaelic oath  evan started forward to the rescue  and almost at the same moment the small figure of the missing man appeared on the ridge against the sky .', 'even at that distance  however  there was something odd about his attitude  so odd that macian continued to make his way in that direction .', 'it looked as if he were wounded  or  still more  as if he were ill .', 'he wavered as he came down the slope and seemed flinging himself into peculiar postures .', 'but it was only when he came within three feet of macian  s face  that that observer of mankind fully realized that mr . james turnbull was roaring with laughter .', ' you are quit right  sobbed that wholly demoralized journalist .', ' he  s black  oh  there  s no doubt the black  s all right  as far as it goes .', 'and he went off again into convulsions of his humorous ailment .', ' what ever is the matter with you ', 'asked macian  with stern impatience .', ' did you see the nigger ', ' i saw the nigger  gasped turnbull .', ' i saw the splendid barbarian chief .', 'i saw the emperor of ethiopia  oh  i saw him all right .', 'the nigger  s hands and face are a lovely colour  and the nigger  and he was overtaken once more .', ' well  well  well  said evan  stamping each monosyllable on the sand   what about the nigger ', ' well  the truth is  said turnbull  suddenly and startlingly  becoming quite grave and precise   the truth is  the nigger is a margate nigger  and we are now on the edge of the isle of thanet  a few miles from margate .', 'then he had a momentary return of his hysteria and said   i say  old boy  i should like to see a chart of our fortnight  s cruise in wilkinson  s yacht .', 'macian had no smile in answer  but his eager lips opened as if parched for the truth .', ' you mean to say  he began ', ' yes  i mean to say  said turnbull   and i mean to say something funnier still .', 'i have learnt everything i wanted to know from the partially black musician over there  who has taken a run in his war  paint to meet a friend in a quiet pub along the coast  the noble savage has told me all about it .', 'the bottle containing our declaration  doctrines  and dying sentiments was washed up on margate beach yesterday in the presence of one alderman  two bathing  machine men  three policemen  seven doctors  and a hundred and thirteen london clerks on a holiday  to all of whom  whether directly or indirectly  our composition gave enormous literary pleasure .', 'buck up  old man  this story of ours is a switchback .', 'i have begun to understand the pulse and the time of it  now we are up in a cathedral and then we are down in a theatre  where they only play farces .', 'come  i am quite reconciled  let us enjoy the farce .', 'but macian said nothing  and an instant afterwards turnbull himself called out in an entirely changed voice   oh  this is damnable ', 'this is not to be borne ', 'macian followed his eye along the sand  hills .', 'he saw what looked like the momentary and waving figure of the nigger minstrel  and then he saw a heavy running policeman take the turn of the sand  hill with the smooth solemnity of a railway train .', 'xiii .', 'the garden of peace', 'up to this instant evan macian had really understood nothing  but when he saw the policeman he saw everything .', 'he saw his enemies  all the powers and princes of the earth .', 'he suddenly altered from a staring statue to a leaping man of the mountains .', ' we must break away from him here  he cried  briefly  and went like a whirlwind over the sand ridge in a straight line and at a particular angle .', 'when the policeman had finished his admirable railway curve  he found a wall of failing sand between him and the pursued .', 'by the time he had scaled it thrice  slid down twice  and crested it in the third effort  the two flying figures were far in front .', 'they found the sand harder farther on  it began to be crusted with scraps of turf and in a few moments they were flying easily over an open common of rank sea  grass .', 'they had no easy business  however  for the bottle which they had so innocently sent into the chief gate of thanet had called to life the police of half a county on their trail .', 'from every side across the grey  green common figures could be seen running and closing in  and it was only when macian with his big body broke down the tangled barrier of a little wood  as men break down a door with the shoulder  it was only when they vanished crashing into the underworld of the black wood  that their hunters were even instantaneously thrown off the scent .', 'at the risk of struggling a little longer like flies in that black web of twigs and trunks  evan  who had an instinct of the hunter or the hunted  took an incalculable course through the forest  which let them out at last by a forest opening  quite forgotten by the leaders of the chase .', 'they ran a mile or two farther along the edge of the wood until they reached another and somewhat similar opening .', 'then macian stood utterly still and listened  as animals listen  for every sound in the universe .', 'then he said   we are quit of them .', 'and turnbull said   where shall we go now ', 'macian looked at the silver sunset that was closing in  barred by plumy lines of purple cloud  he looked at the high tree  tops that caught the last light and at the birds going heavily homeward  just as if all these things were bits of written advice that he could read .', 'then he said   the best place we can go to is to bed .', 'if we can get some sleep in this wood  now everyone has cleared out of it  it will be worth a handicap of two hundred yards tomorrow .', 'turnbull  who was exceptionally lively and laughing in his demeanour  kicked his legs about like a schoolboy and said he did not want to go to sleep .', 'he walked incessantly and talked very brilliantly .', 'and when at last he lay down on the hard earth  sleep struck him senseless like a hammer .', 'indeed  he needed the strongest sleep he could get  for the earth was still full of darkness and a kind of morning fog when his fellow  fugitive shook him awake .', ' no more sleep  i  m afraid  said evan  in a heavy  almost submissive  voice of apology .', ' they  ve gone on past us right enough for a good thirty miles  but now they  ve found out their mistake  and they  re coming back .', ' are you sure ', 'said turnbull  sitting up and rubbing his red eyebrows with his hand .', 'the next moment  however  he had jumped up alive and leaping like a man struck with a shock of cold water  and he was plunging after macian along the woodland path .', 'the shape of their old friend the constable had appeared against the pearl and pink of the sunrise .', 'somehow  it always looked a very funny shape when seen against the sunrise .', '  ', 'a wash of weary daylight was breaking over the country  side  and the fields and roads were full of white mist  the kind of white mist that clings in corners like cotton wool .', 'the empty road  along which the chase had taken its turn  was overshadowed on one side by a very high discoloured wall  stained  and streaked green  as with seaweed  evidently the high  shouldered sentinel of some great gentleman  s estate .', 'a yard or two from the wall ran parallel to it a linked and tangled line of lime  trees  forming a kind of cloister along the side of the road .', 'it was under this branching colonnade that the two fugitives fled  almost concealed from their pursuers by the twilight  the mist and the leaping zoetrope of shadows .', 'their feet  though beating the ground furiously  made but a faint noise  for they had kicked away their boots in the wood  their long  antiquated weapons made no jingle or clatter  for they had strapped them across their backs like guitars .', 'they had all the advantages that invisibility and silence can add to speed .', 'a hundred and fifty yards behind them down the centre of the empty road the first of their pursuers came pounding and panting  a fat but powerful policeman who had distanced all the rest .', 'he came on at a splendid pace for so portly a figure  but  like all heavy bodies in motion  he gave the impression that it would be easier for him to increase his pace than to slacken it suddenly .', 'nothing short of a brick wall could have abruptly brought him up .', 'turnbull turned his head slightly and found breath to say something to macian .', 'macian nodded .', 'pursuer and pursued were fixed in their distance as they fled  for some quarter of a mile  when they came to a place where two or three of the trees grew twistedly together  making a special obscurity .', 'past this place the pursuing policeman went thundering without thought or hesitation .', 'but he was pursuing his shadow or the wind  for turnbull had put one foot in a crack of the tree and gone up it as quickly and softly as a cat .', 'somewhat more laboriously but in equal silence the long legs of the highlander had followed  and crouching in crucial silence in the cloud of leaves  they saw the whole posse of their pursuers go by and die into the dust and mists of the distance .', 'the white vapour lay  as it often does  in lean and palpable layers  and even the head of the tree was above it in the half  daylight  like a green ship swinging on a sea of foam .', 'but higher yet behind them  and readier to catch the first coming of the sun  ran the rampart of the top of the wall  which in their excitement of escape looked at once indispensable and unattainable  like the wall of heaven .', 'here  however  it was macian  s turn to have the advantage  for  though less light  limbed and feline  he was longer and stronger in the arms .', 'in two seconds he had tugged up his chin over the wall like a horizontal bar  the next he sat astride of it  like a horse of stone .', 'with his assistance turnbull vaulted to the same perch  and the two began cautiously to shift along the wall in the direction by which they had come  doubling on their tracks to throw off the last pursuit .', 'macian could not rid himself of the fancy of bestriding a steed  the long  grey coping of the wall shot out in front of him  like the long  grey neck of some nightmare rosinante .', 'he had the quaint thought that he and turnbull were two knights on one steed on the old shield of the templars .', 'the nightmare of the stone horse was increased by the white fog  which seemed thicker inside the wall than outside .', 'they could make nothing of the enclosure upon which they were partial trespassers  except that the green and crooked branches of a big apple  tree came crawling at them out of the mist  like the tentacles of some green cuttlefish .', 'anything would serve  however  that was likely to confuse their trail  so they both decided without need of words to use this tree also as a ladder  a ladder of descent .', 'when they dropped from the lowest branch to the ground their stockinged feet felt hard gravel beneath them .', 'they had alighted in the middle of a very broad garden path  and the clearing mist permitted them to see the edge of a well  clipped lawn .', 'though the white vapour was still a veil  it was like the gauzy veil of a transformation scene in a pantomime  for through it there glowed shapeless masses of colour  masses which might be clouds of sunrise or mosaics of gold and crimson  or ladies robed in ruby and emerald draperies .', 'as it thinned yet farther they saw that it was only flowers  but flowers in such insolent mass and magnificence as can seldom be seen out of the tropics .', 'purple and crimson rhododendrons rose arrogantly  like rampant heraldic animals against their burning background of laburnum gold .', 'the roses were red hot  the clematis was  so to speak  blue hot .', 'and yet the mere whiteness of the syringa seemed the most violent colour of all .', 'as the golden sunlight gradually conquered the mists  it had really something of the sensational sweetness of the slow opening of the gates of eden .', 'macian  whose mind was always haunted with such seraphic or titanic parallels  made some such remark to his companion .', 'but turnbull only cursed and said that it was the back garden of some damnable rich man .', 'when the last haze had faded from the ordered paths  the open lawns  and the flaming flower  beds  the two realized  not without an abrupt re  examination of their position  that they were not alone in the garden .', 'down the centre of the central garden path  preceded by a blue cloud from a cigarette  was walking a gentleman who evidently understood all the relish of a garden in the very early morning .', 'he was a slim yet satisfied figure  clad in a suit of pale  grey tweed  so subdued that the pattern was imperceptible  a costume that was casual but not by any means careless .', 'his face  which was reflective and somewhat over  refined  was the face of a quite elderly man  though his stringy hair and moustache were still quite yellow .', 'a double eye  glass  with a broad  black ribbon  drooped from his aquiline nose  and he smiled  as he communed with himself  with a self  content which was rare and almost irritating .', 'the straw panama on his head was many shades shabbier than his clothes  as if he had caught it up by accident .', 'it needed the full shock of the huge shadow of macian  falling across his sunlit path  to rouse him from his smiling reverie .', 'when this had fallen on him he lifted his head a little and blinked at the intruders with short  sighted benevolence  but with far less surprise than might have been expected .', 'he was a gentleman  that is  he had social presence of mind  whether for kindness or for insolence .', ' can i do anything for you ', 'he said  at last .', 'macian bowed .', ' you can extend to us your pardon  he said  for he also came of a whole race of gentlemen  of gentlemen without shirts to their backs .', ' i am afraid we are trespassing .', 'we have just come over the wall .', ' over the wall ', 'repeated the smiling old gentleman  still without letting his surprise come uppermost .', ' i suppose i am not wrong  sir  continued macian   in supposing that these grounds inside the wall belong to you ', 'the man in the panama looked at the ground and smoked thoughtfully for a few moments  after which he said  with a sort of matured conviction ', ' yes  certainly  the grounds inside the wall really belong to me  and the grounds outside the wall  too .', ' a large proprietor  i imagine  said turnbull  with a truculent eye .', ' yes  answered the old gentleman  looking at him with a steady smile .', ' a large proprietor .', 'turnbull  s eye grew even more offensive  and he began biting his red beard  but macian seemed to recognize a type with which he could deal and continued quite easily ', ' i am sure that a man like you will not need to be told that one sees and does a good many things that do not get into the newspapers .', 'things which  on the whole  had better not get into the newspapers .', 'the smile of the large proprietor broadened for a moment under his loose  light moustache  and the other continued with increased confidence ', ' one sometimes wants to have it out with another man .', 'the police won  t allow it in the streets  and then there  s the county council  and in the fields even nothing  s allowed but posters of pills .', 'but in a gentleman  s garden  now ', 'the strange gentleman smiled again and said  easily enough   do you want to fight ', 'what do you want to fight about ', 'macian had understood his man pretty well up to that point  an instinct common to all men with the aristocratic tradition of europe had guided him .', 'he knew that the kind of man who in his own back garden wears good clothes and spoils them with a bad hat is not the kind of man who has an abstract horror of illegal actions of violence or the evasion of the police .', 'but a man may understand ragging and yet be very far from understanding religious ragging .', 'this seeming host of theirs might comprehend a quarrel of husband and lover or a difficulty at cards or even escape from a pursuing tailor  but it still remained doubtful whether he would feel the earth fail under him in that earthquake instant when the virgin is compared to a goddess of mesopotamia .', 'even macian  therefore  whose tact was far from being his strong point  felt the necessity for some compromise in the mode of approach .', 'at last he said  and even then with hesitation ', ' we are fighting about god  there can be nothing so important as that .', 'the tilted eye  glasses of the old gentleman fell abruptly from his nose  and he thrust his aristocratic chin so far forward that his lean neck seemed to shoot out longer like a telescope .', ' about god ', 'he queried  in a key completely new .', ' look here ', 'cried turnbull  taking his turn roughly   i  ll tell you what it  s all about .', 'i think that there  s no god .', 'i take it that it  s nobody  s business but mine  or god  s  if there is one .', 'this young gentleman from the highlands happens to think that it  s his business .', 'in consequence  he first takes a walking  stick and smashes my shop  then he takes the same walking  stick and tries to smash me .', 'to this i naturally object .', 'i suggest that if it comes to that we should both have sticks .', 'he improves on the suggestion and proposes that we should both have steel  pointed sticks .', 'the police  with characteristic unreasonableness  will not accept either of our proposals  the result is that we run about dodging the police and have jumped over our garden wall into your magnificent garden to throw ourselves on your magnificent hospitality .', 'the face of the old gentleman had grown redder and redder during this address  but it was still smiling  and when he broke out it was with a kind of guffaw .', ' so you really want to fight with drawn swords in my garden  he asked   about whether there is really a god ', ' why not ', 'said macian  with his simple monstrosity of speech   all man  s worship began when the garden of eden was founded .', ' yes  by ', 'said turnbull  with an oath   and ended when the zoological gardens were founded .', ' in this garden ', 'in my presence ', 'cried the stranger  stamping up and down the gravel and choking with laughter  whether there is a god ', 'and he went stamping up and down the garden  making it echo with his unintelligible laughter .', 'then he came back to them more composed and wiping his eyes .', ' why  how small the world is ', 'he cried at last .', ' i can settle the whole matter .', 'why  i am god ', 'and he suddenly began to kick and wave his well  clad legs about the lawn .', ' you are what ', 'repeated turnbull  in a tone which is beyond description .', ' why  god  of course ', 'answered the other  thoroughly amused .', ' how funny it is to think that you have tumbled over a garden wall and fallen exactly on the right person ', 'you might have gone floundering about in all sorts of churches and chapels and colleges and schools of philosophy looking for some evidence of the existence of god .', 'why  there is no evidence  except seeing him .', 'and now you  ve seen him .', 'you  ve seen him dance ', 'and the obliging old gentleman instantly stood on one leg without relaxing at all the grave and cultured benignity of his expression .', ' i understood that this garden  began the bewildered macian .', ' quite so ', 'quite so ', 'said the man on one leg  nodding gravely .', ' i said this garden belonged to me and the land outside it .', 'so they do .', 'so does the country beyond that and the sea beyond that and all the rest of the earth .', 'so does the moon .', 'so do the sun and stars .', 'and he added  with a smile of apology   you see  i  m god .', 'turnbull and macian looked at him for one moment with a sort of notion that perhaps he was not too old to be merely playing the fool .', 'but after staring steadily for an instant turnbull saw the hard and horrible earnestness in the man  s eyes behind all his empty animation .', 'then turnbull looked very gravely at the strict gravel walls and the gay flower  beds and the long rectangular red  brick building  which the mist had left evident beyond them .', 'then he looked at macian .', 'almost at the same moment another man came walking quickly round the regal clump of rhododendrons .', 'he had the look of a prosperous banker  wore a good tall silk hat  was almost stout enough to burst the buttons of a fine frock  coat  but he was talking to himself  and one of his elbows had a singular outward jerk as he went by .', 'xiv .', 'a museum of souls', 'the man with the good hat and the jumping elbow went by very quickly  yet the man with the bad hat  who thought he was god  overtook him .', 'he ran after him and jumped over a bed of geraniums to catch him .', ' i beg your majesty  s pardon  he said  with mock humility   but here is a quarrel which you ought really to judge .', 'then as he led the heavy  silk  hatted man back towards the group  he caught macian  s ear in order to whisper   this poor gentleman is mad  he thinks he is edward vii .', 'at this the self  appointed creator slightly winked .', ' of course you won  t trust him much  come to me for everything .', 'but in my position one has to meet so many people .', 'one has to be broadminded .', 'the big banker in the black frock  coat and hat was standing quite grave and dignified on the lawn  save for his slight twitch of one limb  and he did not seem by any means unworthy of the part which the other promptly forced upon him .', ' my dear fellow  said the man in the straw hat   these two gentlemen are going to fight a duel of the utmost importance .', 'your own royal position and my much humbler one surely indicate us as the proper seconds .', 'seconds  yes  seconds  and here the speaker was once more shaken with his old malady of laughter .', ' yes  you and i are both seconds  and these two gentlemen can obviously fight in front of us .', 'you  he  he  are the king .', 'i am god  really  they could hardly have better supporters .', 'they have come to the right place .', 'then turnbull  who had been staring with a frown at the fresh turf  burst out with a rather bitter laugh and cried  throwing his red head in the air ', ' yes  by god  macian  i think we have come to the right place ', 'and macian answered  with an adamantine stupidity ', ' any place is the right place where they will let us do it .', 'there was a long stillness  and their eyes involuntarily took in the landscape  as they had taken in all the landscapes of their everlasting combat  the bright  square garden behind the shop  the whole lift and leaning of the side of hampstead heath  the little garden of the decadent choked with flowers  the square of sand beside the sea at sunrise .', 'they both felt at the same moment all the breadth and blossoming beauty of that paradise  the coloured trees  the natural and restful nooks and also the great wall of stone  more awful than the wall of china  from which no flesh could flee .', 'turnbull was moodily balancing his sword in his hand as the other spoke  then he started  for a mouth whispered quite close to his ear .', 'with a softness incredible in any cat  the huge  heavy man in the black hat and frock  coat had crept across the lawn from his own side and was saying in his ear   don  t trust that second of yours .', 'he  s mad and not so mad  either  for he frightfully cunning and sharp .', 'don  t believe the story he tells you about why i hate him .', 'i know the story he  ll tell  i overheard it when the housekeeper was talking to the postman .', 'it  s too long to talk about now  and i expect we  re watched  but ', 'something in turnbull made him want suddenly to be sick on the grass  the mere healthy and heathen horror of the unclean  the mere inhumane hatred of the inhuman state of madness .', 'he seemed to hear all round him the hateful whispers of that place  innumerable as leaves whispering in the wind  and each of them telling eagerly some evil that had not happened or some terrific secret which was not true .', 'all the rationalist and plain man revolted within him against bowing down for a moment in that forest of deception and egotistical darkness .', 'he wanted to blow up that palace of delusions with dynamite  and in some wild way  which i will not defend  he tried to do it .', 'he looked across at macian and said   oh  i can  t stand this ', ' can  t stand what ', 'asked his opponent  eyeing him doubtfully .', ' shall we say the atmosphere ', 'replied turnbull   one can  t use uncivil expressions even to a  deity .', 'the fact is  i don  t like having god for my second .', ' sir ', 'said that being in a state of great offence   in my position i am not used to having my favours refused .', 'do you know who i am ', 'the editor of the atheist turned upon him like one who has lost all patience  and exploded   yes  you are god  aren  t you ', 'he said  abruptly   why do we have two sets of teeth ', ' teeth ', 'spluttered the genteel lunatic   teeth ', ' yes  cried turnbull  advancing on him swiftly and with animated gestures   why does teething hurt ', 'why do growing pains hurt ', 'why are measles catching ', 'why does a rose have thorns ', 'why do rhinoceroses have horns ', 'why is the horn on the top of the nose ', 'why haven  t i a horn on the top of my nose  eh ', 'and he struck the bridge of his nose smartly with his forefinger to indicate the place of the omission and then wagged the finger menacingly at the creator .', ' i  ve often wanted to meet you  he resumed  sternly  after a pause   to hold you accountable for all the idiocy and cruelty of this muddled and meaningless world of yours .', 'you make a hundred seeds and only one bears fruit .', 'you make a million worlds and only one seems inhabited .', 'what do you mean by it  eh ', 'what do you mean by it ', 'the unhappy lunatic had fallen back before this quite novel form of attack  and lifted his burnt  out cigarette almost like one warding off a blow .', 'turnbull went on like a torrent .', ' a man died yesterday in ealing .', 'you murdered him .', 'a girl had the toothache in croydon .', 'you gave it her .', 'fifty sailors were drowned off selsey bill .', 'you scuttled their ship .', 'what have you got to say for yourself  eh ', 'the representative of omnipotence looked as if he had left most of these things to his subordinates  he passed a hand over his wrinkling brow and said in a voice much saner than any he had yet used ', ' well  if you dislike my assistance  of course  perhaps the other gentleman ', ' the other gentleman  cried turnbull  scornfully   is a submissive and loyal and obedient gentleman .', 'he likes the people who wear crowns  whether of diamonds or of stars .', 'he believes in the divine right of kings  and it is appropriate enough that he should have the king for his second .', 'but it is not appropriate to me that i should have god for my second .', 'god is not good enough .', 'i dislike and i deny the divine right of kings .', 'but i dislike more and i deny more the divine right of divinity .', 'then after a pause in which he swallowed his passion  he said to macian   you have got the right second  anyhow .', 'the highlander did not answer  but stood as if thunderstruck with one long and heavy thought .', 'then at last he turned abruptly to his second in the silk hat and said   who are you ', 'the man in the silk hat blinked and bridled in affected surprise  like one who was in truth accustomed to be doubted .', ' i am king edward vii  he said  with shaky arrogance .', ' do you doubt my word ', ' i do not doubt it in the least  answered macian .', ' then  why  said the large man in the silk hat  trembling from head to foot   why do you wear your hat before the king ', ' why should i take it off  retorted macian  with equal heat   before a usurper ', 'turnbull swung round on his heel .', ' well  really  he said   i thought at least you were a loyal subject .', ' i am the only loyal subject  answered the gael .', ' for nearly thirty years i have walked these islands and have not found another .', ' you are always hard to follow  remarked turnbull  genially   and sometimes so much so as to be hardly worth following .', ' i alone am loyal  insisted macian   for i alone am in rebellion .', 'i am ready at any instant to restore the stuarts .', 'i am ready at any instant to defy the hanoverian brood  and i defy it now even when face to face with the actual ruler of the enormous british empire ', 'and folding his arms and throwing back his lean  hawklike face  he haughtily confronted the man with the formal frock  coat and the eccentric elbow .', ' what right had you stunted german squires  he cried   to interfere in a quarrel between scotch and english and irish gentlemen ', 'who made you  whose fathers could not splutter english while they walked in whitehall  who made you the judge between the republic of sidney and the monarchy of montrose ', 'what had your sires to do with england that they should have the foul offering of the blood of derwentwater and the heart of jimmy dawson ', 'where are the corpses of culloden ', 'where is the blood of lochiel ', 'macian advanced upon his opponent with a bony and pointed finger  as if indicating the exact pocket in which the blood of that cameron was probably kept  and edward vii fell back a few paces in considerable confusion .', ' what good have you ever done to us ', 'he continued in harsher and harsher accents  forcing the other back towards the flower  beds .', ' what good have you ever done  you race of german sausages ', 'yards of barbarian etiquette  to throttle the freedom of aristocracy ', 'gas of northern metaphysics to blow up broad church bishops like balloons .', 'bad pictures and bad manners and pantheism and the albert memorial .', 'go back to hanover  you humbug ', 'go to ', 'before the end of this tirade the arrogance of the monarch had entirely given way  he had fairly turned tail and was trundling away down the path .', 'macian strode after him still preaching and flourishing his large  lean hands .', 'the other two remained in the centre of the lawn  turnbull in convulsions of laughter  the lunatic in convulsions of disgust .', 'almost at the same moment a third figure came stepping swiftly across the lawn .', 'the advancing figure walked with a stoop  and yet somehow flung his forked and narrow beard forward .', 'that carefully cut and pointed yellow beard was  indeed  the most emphatic thing about him .', 'when he clasped his hands behind him  under the tails of his coat  he would wag his beard at a man like a big forefinger .', 'it performed almost all his gestures  it was more important than the glittering eye  glasses through which he looked or the beautiful bleating voice in which he spoke .', 'his face and neck were of a lusty red  but lean and stringy  he always wore his expensive gold  rim eye  glasses slightly askew upon his aquiline nose  and he always showed two gleaming foreteeth under his moustache  in a smile so perpetual as to earn the reputation of a sneer .', 'but for the crooked glasses his dress was always exquisite  and but for the smile he was perfectly and perennially depressed .', ' don  t you think  said the new  comer  with a sort of supercilious entreaty   that we had better all come into breakfast ', 'it is such a mistake to wait for breakfast .', 'it spoils one  s temper so much .', ' quite so  replied turnbull  seriously .', ' there seems almost to have been a little quarrelling here  said the man with the goatish beard .', ' it is rather a long story  said turnbull  smiling .', ' originally  it might be called a phase in the quarrel between science and religion .', 'the new  comer started slightly  and turnbull replied to the question on his face .', ' oh  yes  he said   i am science ', ' i congratulate you heartily  answered the other   i am doctor quayle .', 'turnbull  s eyes did not move  but he realized that the man in the panama hat had lost all his ease of a landed proprietor and had withdrawn to a distance of thirty yards  where he stood glaring with all the contraction of fear and hatred that can stiffen a cat .', '  ', 'macian was sitting somewhat disconsolately on a stump of tree  his large black head half buried in his large brown hands  when turnbull strode up to him chewing a cigarette .', 'he did not look up  but his comrade and enemy addressed him like one who must free himself of his feelings .', ' well  i hope  at any rate  he said   that you like your precious religion now .', 'i hope you like the society of this poor devil whom your damned tracts and hymns and priests have driven out of his wits .', 'five men in this place  they tell me  five men in this place who might have been fathers of families  and every one of them thinks he is god the father .', 'oh ', 'you may talk about the ugliness of science  but there is no one here who thinks he is protoplasm .', ' they naturally prefer a bright part  said macian  wearily .', ' protoplasm is not worth going mad about .', ' at least  said turnbull  savagely   it was your jesus christ who started all this bosh about being god .', 'for one instant macian opened the eyes of battle  then his tightened lips took a crooked smile and he said  quite calmly ', ' no  the idea is older  it was satan who first said that he was god .', ' then  what  asked turnbull  very slowly  as he softly picked a flower   what is the difference between christ and satan ', ' it is quite simple  replied the highlander .', ' christ descended into hell  satan fell into it .', ' does it make much odds ', 'asked the free  thinker .', ' it makes all the odds  said the other .', ' one of them wanted to go up and went down  the other wanted to go down and went up .', 'a god can be humble  a devil can only be humbled .', ' why are you always wanting to humble a man ', 'asked turnbull  knitting his brows .', ' it affects me as ungenerous .', ' why were you wanting to humble a god when you found him in this garden ', 'asked macian .', ' that was an extreme case of impudence  said turnbull .', ' granting the man his almighty pretensions  i think he was very modest  said macian .', ' it is we who are arrogant  who know we are only men .', 'the ordinary man in the street is more of a monster than that poor fellow  for the man in the street treats himself as god almighty when he knows he isn  t .', 'he expects the universe to turn round him  though he knows he isn  t the centre .', ' well  said turnbull  sitting down on the grass   this is a digression  anyhow .', 'what i want to point out is  that your faith does end in asylums and my science doesn  t .', ' doesn  t it  by george ', 'cried macian  scornfully .', ' there are a few men here who are mad on god and a few who are mad on the bible .', 'but i bet there are many more who are simply mad on madness .', ' do you really believe it ', 'asked the other .', ' scores of them  i should say  answered macian .', ' fellows who have read medical books or fellows whose fathers and uncles had something hereditary in their heads  the whole air they breathe is mad .', ' all the same  said turnbull  shrewdly   i bet you haven  t found a madman of that sort .', ' i bet i have ', 'cried evan  with unusual animation .', ' i  ve been walking about the garden talking to a poor chap all the morning .', 'he  s simply been broken down and driven raving by your damned science .', 'talk about believing one is god  why  it  s quite an old  comfortable  fireside fancy compared with the sort of things this fellow believes .', 'he believes that there is a god  but that he is better than god .', 'he says god will be afraid to face him .', 'he says one is always progressing beyond the best .', 'he put his arm in mine and whispered in my ear  as if it were the apocalypse   never trust a god that you can  t improve on .', ' what can he have meant ', 'said the atheist  with all his logic awake .', ' obviously one should not trust any god that one can improve on .', ' it is the way he talks  said macian  almost indifferently   but he says rummier things than that .', 'he says that a man  s doctor ought to decide what woman he marries  and he says that children ought not to be brought up by their parents  because a physical partiality will then distort the judgement of the educator .', ' oh  dear ', 'said turnbull  laughing   you have certainly come across a pretty bad case  and incidentally proved your own .', 'i suppose some men do lose their wits through science as through love and other good things .', ' and he says  went on macian  monotonously   that he cannot see why anyone should suppose that a triangle is a three  sided figure .', 'he says that on some higher plane ', 'turnbull leapt to his feet as by an electric shock .', ' i never could have believed  he cried   that you had humour enough to tell a lie .', 'you  ve gone a bit too far  old man  with your little joke .', 'even in a lunatic asylum there can  t be anybody who  having thought about the matter  thinks that a triangle has not got three sides .', 'if he exists he must be a new era in human psychology .', 'but he doesn  t exist .', ' i will go and fetch him  said macian  calmly   i left the poor fellow wandering about by the nasturtium bed .', 'macian vanished  and in a few moments returned  trailing with him his own discovery among lunatics  who was a slender man with a fixed smile and an unfixed and rolling head .', 'he had a goatlike beard just long enough to be shaken in a strong wind .', 'turnbull sprang to his feet and was like one who is speechless through choking a sudden shout of laughter .', ' why  you great donkey  he shouted  in an ear  shattering whisper   that  s not one of the patients at all .', 'that  s one of the doctors .', 'evan looked back at the leering head with the long  pointed beard and repeated the word inquiringly   one of the doctors ', ' oh  you know what i mean  said turnbull  impatiently .', ' the medical authorities of the place .', 'evan was still staring back curiously at the beaming and bearded creature behind him .', ' the mad doctors  said turnbull  shortly .', ' quite so  said macian .', 'after a rather restless silence turnbull plucked macian by the elbow and pulled him aside .', ' for goodness sake  he said   don  t offend this fellow  he may be as mad as ten hatters  if you like  but he has us between his finger and thumb .', 'this is the very time he appointed to talk with us about our  well  our exeat .', ' but what can it matter ', 'asked the wondering macian .', ' he can  t keep us in the asylum .', 'we  re not mad .', ' jackass ', 'said turnbull  heartily   of course we  re not mad .', 'of course  if we are medically examined and the thing is thrashed out  they will find we are not mad .', 'but don  t you see that if the thing is thrashed out it will mean letters to this reference and telegrams to that  and at the first word of who we are  we shall be taken out of a madhouse  where we may smoke  to a jail  where we mayn  t .', 'no  if we manage this very quietly  he may merely let us out at the front door as stray revellers .', 'if there  s half an hour of inquiry  we are cooked .', 'macian looked at the grass frowningly for a few seconds  and then said in a new  small and childish voice   i am awfully stupid  mr . turnbull  you must be patient with me .', 'turnbull caught evan  s elbow again with quite another gesture .', ' come  he cried  with the harsh voice of one who hides emotion   come and let us be tactful in chorus .', 'the doctor with the pointed beard was already slanting it forward at a more than usually acute angle  with the smile that expressed expectancy .', ' i hope i do not hurry you  gentlemen  he said  with the faintest suggestion of a sneer at their hurried consultation   but i believe you wanted to see me at half past eleven .', ' i am most awfully sorry  doctor  said turnbull  with ready amiability   i never meant to keep you waiting  but the silly accident that has landed us in your garden may have some rather serious consequences to our friends elsewhere  and my friend here was just drawing my attention to some of them .', ' quite so ', 'quite so ', 'said the doctor  hurriedly .', ' if you really want to put anything before me  i can give you a few moments in my consulting  room .', 'he led them rapidly into a small but imposing apartment  which seemed to be built and furnished entirely in red  varnished wood .', 'there was one desk occupied with carefully docketed papers  and there were several chairs of the red  varnished wood  though of different shape .', 'all along the wall ran something that might have been a bookcase  only that it was not filled with books  but with flat  oblong slabs or cases of the same polished dark  red consistency .', 'what those flat wooden cases were they could form no conception .', 'the doctor sat down with a polite impatience on his professional perch  macian remained standing  but turnbull threw himself almost with luxury into a hard wooden arm  chair .', ' this is a most absurd business  doctor  he said   and i am ashamed to take up the time of busy professional men with such pranks from outside .', 'the plain fact is  that he and i and a pack of silly men and girls have organized a game across this part of the country  a sort of combination of hare and hounds and hide and seek  i dare say you  ve heard of it .', 'we are the hares  and  seeing your high wall look so inviting  we tumbled over it  and naturally were a little startled with what we found on the other side .', ' quite so ', 'said the doctor  mildly .', ' i can understand that you were startled .', 'turnbull had expected him to ask what place was the headquarters of the new exhilarating game  and who were the male and female enthusiasts who had brought it to such perfection  in fact  turnbull was busy making up these personal and topographical particulars .', 'as the doctor did not ask the question  he grew slightly uneasy  and risked the question   i hope you will accept my assurance that the thing was an accident and that no intrusion was meant .', ' oh  yes  sir  replied the doctor  smiling   i accept everything that you say .', ' in that case  said turnbull  rising genially   we must not further interrupt your important duties .', 'i suppose there will be someone to let us out ', ' no  said the doctor  still smiling steadily and pleasantly   there will be no one to let you out .', ' can we let ourselves out  then ', 'asked turnbull  in some surprise .', ' why  of course not  said the beaming scientist   think how dangerous that would be in a place like this .', ' then  how the devil are we to get out ', 'cried turnbull  losing his manners for the first time .', ' it is a question of time  of receptivity  and treatment  said the doctor  arching his eyebrows indifferently .', ' i do not regard either of your cases as incurable .', 'and with that the man of the world was struck dumb  and  as in all intolerable moments  the word was with the unworldly .', 'macian took one stride to the table  leant across it  and said   we can  t stop here  we  re not mad people ', ' we don  t use the crude phrase  said the doctor  smiling at his patent  leather boots .', ' but you can  t think us mad  thundered macian .', ' you never saw us before .', 'you know nothing about us .', 'you haven  t even examined us .', 'the doctor threw back his head and beard .', ' oh  yes  he said   very thoroughly .', ' but you can  t shut a man up on your mere impressions without documents or certificates or anything ', 'the doctor got languidly to his feet .', ' quite so  he said .', ' you certainly ought to see the documents .', 'he went across to the curious mock book  shelves and took down one of the flat mahogany cases .', 'this he opened with a curious key at his watch  chain  and laying back a flap revealed a quire of foolscap covered with close but quite clear writing .', 'the first three words were in such large copy  book hand that they caught the eye even at a distance .', 'they were   macian  evan stuart .', 'evan bent his angry eagle face over it  yet something blurred it and he could never swear he saw it distinctly .', 'he saw something that began   prenatal influences predisposing to mania .', 'grandfather believed in return of the stuarts .', 'mother carried bone of st . eulalia with which she touched children in sickness .', 'marked religious mania at early age ', 'evan fell back and fought for his speech .', ' oh ', 'he burst out at last .', ' oh ', 'if all this world i have walked in had been as sane as my mother was .', 'then he compressed his temples with his hands  as if to crush them .', 'and then lifted suddenly a face that looked fresh and young  as if he had dipped and washed it in some holy well .', ' very well  he cried   i will take the sour with the sweet .', 'i will pay the penalty of having enjoyed god in this monstrous modern earth that cannot enjoy man or beast .', 'i will die happy in your madhouse  only because i know what i know .', 'let it be granted  then  macian is a mystic  macian is a maniac .', 'but this honest shopkeeper and editor whom i have dragged on my inhuman escapades  you cannot keep him .', 'he will go free  thank god  he is not down in any damned document .', 'his ancestor  i am certain  did not die at culloden .', 'his mother  i swear  had no relics .', 'let my friend out of your front door  and as for me ', 'the doctor had already gone across to the laden shelves  and after a few minutes  short  sighted peering  had pulled down another parallelogram of dark  red wood .', 'this also he unlocked on the table  and with the same unerring egotistic eye on of the company saw the words  written in large letters   turnbull  james .', 'hitherto turnbull himself had somewhat scornfully surrendered his part in the whole business  but he was too honest and unaffected not to start at his own name .', 'after the name  the inscription appeared to run   unique case of eleutheromania .', 'parentage  as so often in such cases  prosaic and healthy .', 'eleutheromaniac signs occurred early  however  leading him to attach himself to the individualist bradlaugh .', 'recent outbreak of pure anarchy ', 'turnbull slammed the case to  almost smashing it  and said with a burst of savage laughter   oh ', 'come along  macian  i don  t care so much  even about getting out of the madhouse  if only we get out of this room .', 'you were right enough  macian  when you spoke about  about mad doctors .', 'somehow they found themselves outside in the cool  green garden  and then  after a stunned silence  turnbull said   there is one thing that was puzzling me all the time  and i understand it now .', ' what do you mean ', 'asked evan .', ' no man by will or wit  answered turnbull   can get out of this garden  and yet we got into it merely by jumping over a garden wall .', 'the whole thing explains itself easily enough .', 'that undefended wall was an open trap .', 'it was a trap laid for two celebrated lunatics .', 'they saw us get in right enough .', 'and they will see that we do not get out .', 'evan gazed at the garden wall  gravely for more than a minute  and then he nodded without a word .', 'xv .', 'the dream of macian', 'the system of espionage in the asylum was so effective and complete that in practice the patients could often enjoy a sense of almost complete solitude .', 'they could stray up so near to the wall in an apparently unwatched garden as to find it easy to jump over it .', 'they would only have found the error of their calculations if they had tried to jump .', 'under this insulting liberty  in this artificial loneliness  evan macian was in the habit of creeping out into the garden after dark  especially upon moonlight nights .', 'the moon  indeed  was for him always a positive magnet in a manner somewhat hard to explain to those of a robuster attitude .', 'evidently  apollo is to the full as poetical as diana  but it is not a question of poetry in the matured and intellectual sense of the word .', 'it is a question of a certain solid and childish fancy .', 'the sun is in the strict and literal sense invisible  that is to say  that by our bodily eyes it cannot properly be seen .', 'but the moon is a much simpler thing  a naked and nursery sort of thing .', 'it hangs in the sky quite solid and quite silver and quite useless  it is one huge celestial snowball .', 'it was at least some such infantile facts and fancies which led evan again and again during his dehumanized imprisonment to go out as if to shoot the moon .', 'he was out in the garden on one such luminous and ghostly night  when the steady moonshine toned down all the colours of the garden until almost the strongest tints to be seen were the strong soft blue of the sky and the large lemon moon .', 'he was walking with his face turned up to it in that rather half  witted fashion which might have excused the error of his keepers  and as he gazed he became aware of something little and lustrous flying close to the lustrous orb  like a bright chip knocked off the moon .', 'at first he thought it was a mere sparkle or refraction in his own eyesight  he blinked and cleared his eyes .', 'then he thought it was a falling star  only it did not fall .', 'it jerked awkwardly up and down in a way unknown among meteors and strangely reminiscent of the works of man .', 'the next moment the thing drove right across the moon  and from being silver upon blue  suddenly became black upon silver  then although it passed the field of light in a flash its outline was unmistakable though eccentric .', 'it was a flying ship .', 'the vessel took one long and sweeping curve across the sky and came nearer and nearer to macian  like a steam  engine coming round a bend .', 'it was of pure white steel  and in the moon it gleamed like the armour of sir galahad .', 'the simile of such virginity is not inappropriate  for  as it grew larger and larger and lower and lower  evan saw that the only figure in it was robed in white from head to foot and crowned with snow  white hair  on which the moonshine lay like a benediction .', 'the figure stood so still that he could easily have supposed it to be a statue .', 'indeed  he thought it was until it spoke .', ' evan  said the voice  and it spoke with the simple authority of some forgotten father revisiting his children   you have remained here long enough  and your sword is wanted elsewhere .', ' wanted for what ', 'asked the young man  accepting the monstrous event with a queer and clumsy naturalness   what is my sword wanted for ', ' for all that you hold dear  said the man standing in the moonlight   for the thrones of authority and for all ancient loyalty to law .', 'evan looked up at the lunar orb again as if in irrational appeal  a moon calf bleating to his mother the moon .', 'but the face of luna seemed as witless as his own  there is no help in nature against the supernatural  and he looked again at the tall marble figure that might have been made out of solid moonlight .', 'then he said in a loud voice   who are you ', 'and the next moment was seized by a sort of choking terror lest his question should be answered .', 'but the unknown preserved an impenetrable silence for a long space and then only answered   i must not say who i am until the end of the world  but i may say what i am .', 'i am the law .', 'and he lifted his head so that the moon smote full upon his beautiful and ancient face .', 'the face was the face of a greek god grown old  but not grown either weak or ugly  there was nothing to break its regularity except a rather long chin with a cleft in it  and this rather added distinction than lessened beauty .', 'his strong  well  opened eyes were very brilliant but quite colourless like steel .', 'macian was one of those to whom a reverence and self  submission in ritual come quite easy  and are ordinary things .', 'it was not artificial in him to bend slightly to this solemn apparition or to lower his voice when he said   do you bring me some message ', ' i do bring you a message  answered the man of moon and marble .', ' the king has returned .', 'evan did not ask for or require any explanation .', ' i suppose you can take me to the war  he said  and the silent silver figure only bowed its head again .', 'macian clambered into the silver boat  and it rose upward to the stars .', 'to say that it rose to the stars is no mere metaphor  for the sky had cleared to that occasional and astonishing transparency in which one can see plainly both stars and moon .', 'as the white  robed figure went upward in his white chariot  he said quite quietly to evan   there is an answer to all the folly talked about equality .', 'some stars are big and some small  some stand still and some circle around them as they stand .', 'they can be orderly  but they cannot be equal .', ' they are all very beautiful  said evan  as if in doubt .', ' they are all beautiful  answered the other   because each is in his place and owns his superior .', 'and now england will be beautiful after the same fashion .', 'the earth will be as beautiful as the heavens  because our kings have come back to us .', ' the stuart  began evan  earnestly .', ' yes  answered the old man   that which has returned is stuart and yet older than stuart .', 'it is capet and plantagenet and pendragon .', 'it is all that good old time of which proverbs tell  that golden reign of saturn against which gods and men were rebels .', 'it is all that was ever lost by insolence and overwhelmed in rebellion .', 'it is your own forefather  macian with the broken sword  bleeding without hope at culloden .', 'it is charles refusing to answer the questions of the rebel court .', 'it is mary of the magic face confronting the gloomy and grasping peers and the boorish moralities of knox .', 'it is richard  the last plantagenet  giving his crown to bolingbroke as to a common brigand .', 'it is arthur  overwhelmed in lyonesse by heathen armies and dying in the mist  doubtful if ever he shall return .', ' but now  said evan  in a low voice .', ' but now ', 'said the old man   he has returned .', ' is the war still raging ', 'asked macian .', ' it rages like the pit itself beyond the sea whither i am taking you  answered the other .', ' but in england the king enjoys his own again .', 'the people are once more taught and ruled as is best  they are happy knights  happy squires  happy servants  happy serfs  if you will  but free at last of that load of vexation and lonely vanity which was called being a citizen .', ' is england  indeed  so secure ', 'asked evan .', ' look out and see  said the guide .', ' i fancy you have seen this place before .', 'they were driving through the air towards one region of the sky where the hollow of night seemed darkest and which was quite without stars .', 'but against this black background there sprang up  picked out in glittering silver  a dome and a cross .', 'it seemed that it was really newly covered with silver  which in the strong moonlight was like white flame .', 'but  however  covered or painted  evan had no difficult in knowing the place again .', 'he saw the great thoroughfare that sloped upward to the base of its huge pedestal of steps .', 'and he wondered whether the little shop was still by the side of it and whether its window had been mended .', 'as the flying ship swept round the dome he observed other alterations .', 'the dome had been redecorated so as to give it a more solemn and somewhat more ecclesiastical note  the ball was draped or destroyed  and round the gallery  under the cross  ran what looked like a ring of silver statues  like the little leaden images that stood round the hat of louis xi .', 'round the second gallery  at the base of the dome  ran a second rank of such images  and evan thought there was another round the steps below .', 'when they came closer he saw that they were figures in complete armour of steel or silver  each with a naked sword  point upward  and then he saw one of the swords move .', 'these were not statues but an armed order of chivalry thrown in three circles round the cross .', 'macian drew in his breath  as children do at anything they think utterly beautiful .', 'for he could imagine nothing that so echoed his own visions of pontifical or chivalric art as this white dome sitting like a vast silver tiara over london  ringed with a triple crown of swords .', 'as they went sailing down ludgate hill  evan saw that the state of the streets fully answered his companion  s claim about the reintroduction of order .', 'all the old blackcoated bustle with its cockney vivacity and vulgarity had disappeared .', 'groups of labourers  quietly but picturesquely clad  were passing up and down in sufficiently large numbers  but it required but a few mounted men to keep the streets in order .', 'the mounted men were not common policemen  but knights with spurs and plume whose smooth and splendid armour glittered like diamond rather than steel .', 'only in one place  at the corner of bouverie street  did there appear to be a moment  s confusion  and that was due to hurry rather than resistance .', 'but one old grumbling man did not get out of the way quick enough  and the man on horseback struck him  not severely  across the shoulders with the flat of his sword .', ' the soldier had no business to do that  said macian  sharply .', ' the old man was moving as quickly as he could .', ' we attach great importance to discipline in the streets  said the man in white  with a slight smile .', ' discipline is not so important as justice  said macian .', 'the other did not answer .', 'then after a swift silence that took them out across st . james  s park  he said   the people must be taught to obey  they must learn their own ignorance .', 'and i am not sure  he continued  turning his back on evan and looking out of the prow of the ship into the darkness   i am not sure that i agree with your little maxim about justice .', 'discipline for the whole society is surely more important than justice to an individual .', 'evan  who was also leaning over the edge  swung round with startling suddenness and stared at the other  s back .', ' discipline for society  he repeated  very staccato   more important  justice to individual ', 'then after a long silence he called out   who and what are you ', ' i am an angel  said the white  robed figure  without turning round .', ' you are not a catholic  said macian .', 'the other seemed to take no notice  but reverted to the main topic .', ' in our armies up in heaven we learn to put a wholesome fear into subordinates .', 'macian sat craning his neck forward with an extraordinary and unaccountable eagerness .', ' go on ', 'he cried  twisting and untwisting his long  bony fingers   go on ', ' besides  continued he  in the prow   you must allow for a certain high spirit and haughtiness in the superior type .', ' go on ', 'said evan  with burning eyes .', ' just as the sight of sin offends god  said the unknown   so does the sight of ugliness offend apollo .', 'the beautiful and princely must  of necessity  be impatient with the squalid and ', ' why  you great fool ', 'cried macian  rising to the top of his tremendous stature   did you think i would have doubted only for that rap with a sword ', 'i know that noble orders have bad knights  that good knights have bad tempers  that the church has rough priests and coarse cardinals  i have known it ever since i was born .', 'you fool ', 'you had only to say   yes  it is rather a shame  and i should have forgotten the affair .', 'but i saw on your mouth the twitch of your infernal sophistry  i knew that something was wrong with you and your cathedrals .', 'something is wrong  everything is wrong .', 'you are not an angel .', 'that is not a church .', 'it is not the rightful king who has come home .', ' that is unfortunate  said the other  in a quiet but hard voice   because you are going to see his majesty .', ' no  said macian   i am going to jump over the side .', ' do you desire death ', ' no  said evan  quite composedly   i desire a miracle .', ' from whom do you ask it ', 'to whom do you appeal ', 'said his companion  sternly .', ' you have betrayed the king  renounced his cross on the cathedral  and insulted an archangel .', ' i appeal to god  said evan  and sprang up and stood upon the edge of the swaying ship .', 'the being in the prow turned slowly round  he looked at evan with eyes which were like two suns  and put his hand to his mouth just too late to hide an awful smile .', ' and how do you know  he said   how do you know that i am not god ', 'macian screamed .', ' ah ', 'he cried .', ' now i know who you really are .', 'you are not god .', 'you are not one of god  s angels .', 'but you were once .', 'the being  s hand dropped from his mouth and evan dropped out of the car .', 'xvi .', 'the dream of turnbull', 'turnbull was walking rather rampantly up and down the garden on a gusty evening chewing his cigar and in that mood when every man suppresses an instinct to spit .', 'he was not  as a rule  a man much acquainted with moods  and the storms and sunbursts of macian  s soul passed before him as an impressive but unmeaning panorama  like the anarchy of highland scenery .', 'turnbull was one of those men in whom a continuous appetite and industry of the intellect leave the emotions very simple and steady .', 'his heart was in the right place  but he was quite content to leave it there .', 'it was his head that was his hobby .', 'his mornings and evenings were marked not by impulses or thirsty desires  not by hope or by heart  break  they were filled with the fallacies he had detected  the problems he had made plain  the adverse theories he had wrestled with and thrown  the grand generalizations he had justified .', 'but even the cheerful inner life of a logician may be upset by a lunatic asylum  to say nothing of whiffs of memory from a lady in jersey  and the little red  bearded man on this windy evening was in a dangerous frame of mind .', 'plain and positive as he was  the influence of earth and sky may have been greater on him than he imagined  and the weather that walked the world at that moment was as red and angry as turnbull .', 'long strips and swirls of tattered and tawny cloud were dragged downward to the west exactly as torn red raiment would be dragged .', 'and so strong and pitiless was the wind that it whipped away fragments of red  flowering bushes or of copper beech  and drove them also across the garden  a drift of red leaves  like the leaves of autumn  as in parody of the red and driven rags of cloud .', 'there was a sense in earth and heaven as of everything breaking up  and all the revolutionist in turnbull rejoiced that it was breaking up .', 'the trees were breaking up under the wind  even in the tall strength of their bloom  the clouds were breaking up and losing even their large heraldic shapes .', 'shards and shreds of copper cloud split off continually and floated by themselves  and for some reason the truculent eye of turnbull was attracted to one of these careering cloudlets  which seemed to him to career in an exaggerated manner .', 'also it kept its shape  which is unusual with clouds shaken off  also its shape was of an odd sort .', 'turnbull continued to stare at it  and in a little time occurred that crucial instant when a thing  however incredible  is accepted as a fact .', 'the copper cloud was tumbling down towards the earth  like some gigantic leaf from the copper beeches .', 'and as it came nearer it was evident  first  that it was not a cloud  and  second  that it was not itself of the colour of copper  only  being burnished like a mirror  it had reflected the red  brown colours of the burning clouds .', 'as the thing whirled like a windswept leaf down towards the wall of the garden it was clear that it was some sort of air  ship made of metal  and slapping the air with big broad fins of steel .', 'when it came about a hundred feet above the garden  a shaggy  lean figure leapt up in it  almost black against the bronze and scarlet of the west  and  flinging out a kind of hook or anchor  caught on to the green apple  tree just under the wall  and from that fixed holding ground the ship swung in the red tempest like a captive balloon .', 'while our friend stood frozen for an instant by his astonishment  the queer figure in the airy car tipped the vehicle almost upside down by leaping over the side of it  seemed to slide or drop down the rope like a monkey  and alighted  with impossible precision and placidity  seated on the edge of the wall  over which he kicked and dangled his legs as he grinned at turnbull .', 'the wind roared in the trees yet more ruinous and desolate  the red tails of the sunset were dragged downward like red dragons sucked down to death  and still on the top of the asylum wall sat the sinister figure with the grimace  swinging his feet in tune with the tempest  while above him  at the end of its tossing or tightened cord  the enormous iron air  ship floated as light and as little noticed as a baby  s balloon upon its string .', 'turnbull  s first movement after sixty motionless seconds was to turn round and look at the large  luxuriant parallelogram of the garden and the long  low rectangular building beyond .', 'there was not a soul or a stir of life within sight .', 'and he had a quite meaningless sensation  as if there never really had been any one else there except he since the foundation of the world .', 'stiffening in himself the masculine but mirthless courage of the atheist  he drew a little nearer to the wall and  catching the man at a slightly different angle of the evening light  could see his face and figure quite plain .', 'two facts about him stood out in the picked colours of some piratical schoolboy  s story .', 'the first was that his lean brown body was bare to the belt of his loose white trousers  the other that through hygiene  affectation  or whatever other cause  he had a scarlet handkerchief tied tightly but somewhat aslant across his brow .', 'after these two facts had become emphatic  others appeared sufficiently important .', 'one was that under the scarlet rag the hair was plentiful  but white as with the last snows of mortality .', 'another was that under the mop of white and senile hair the face was strong  handsome  and smiling  with a well  cut profile and a long cloven chin .', 'the length of this lower part of the face and the strange cleft in it  which gave the man  in quite another sense from the common one  a double chin  faintly spoilt the claim of the face to absolute regularity  but it greatly assisted it in wearing the expression of half  smiling and half  sneering arrogance with which it was staring at all the stones  all the flowers  but especially at the solitary man .', ' what do you want ', 'shouted turnbull .', ' i want you  jimmy  said the eccentric man on the wall  and with the very word he had let himself down with a leap on to the centre of the lawn  where he bounded once literally like an india  rubber ball and then stood grinning with his legs astride .', 'the only three facts that turnbull could now add to his inventory were that the man had an ugly  looking knife swinging at his trousers belt  that his brown feet were as bare as his bronzed trunk and arms  and that his eyes had a singular bleak brilliancy which was of no particular colour .', ' excuse my not being in evening dress  said the newcomer with an urbane smile .', ' we scientific men  you know  i have to work my own engines  electrical engineer  very hot work .', ' look here  said turnbull  sturdily clenching his fists in his trousers pockets   i am bound to expect lunatics inside these four walls  but i do bar their coming from outside  bang out of the sunset clouds .', ' and yet you came from the outside  too  jim  said the stranger in a voice almost affectionate .', ' what do you want ', 'asked turnbull  with an explosion of temper as sudden as a pistol shot .', ' i have already told you  said the man  lowering his voice and speaking with evident sincerity   i want you .', ' what do you want with me ', ' i want exactly what you want  said the new  comer with a new gravity .', ' i want the revolution .', 'turnbull looked at the fire  swept sky and the wind  stricken woodlands  and kept on repeating the word voicelessly to himself  the word that did indeed so thoroughly express his mood of rage as it had been among those red clouds and rocking tree  tops .', ' revolution ', 'he said to himself .', ' the revolution  yes  that is what i want right enough  anything  so long as it is a revolution .', 'to some cause he could never explain he found himself completing the sentence on the top of the wall  having automatically followed the stranger so far .', 'but when the stranger silently indicated the rope that led to the machine  he found himself pausing and saying   i can  t leave macian behind in this den .', ' we are going to destroy the pope and all the kings  said the new  comer .', ' would it be wiser to take him with us ', 'somehow the muttering turnbull found himself in the flying ship also  and it swung up into the sunset .', ' all the great rebels have been very little rebels  said the man with the red scarf .', ' they have been like fourth  form boys who sometimes venture to hit a fifth  form boy .', 'that was all the worth of their french revolution and regicide .', 'the boys never really dared to defy the schoolmaster .', ' whom do you mean by the schoolmaster ', 'asked turnbull .', ' you know whom i mean  answered the strange man  as he lay back on cushions and looked up into the angry sky .', 'they seemed rising into stronger and stronger sunlight  as if it were sunrise rather than sunset .', 'but when they looked down at the earth they saw it growing darker and darker .', 'the lunatic asylum in its large rectangular grounds spread below them in a foreshortened and infantile plan  and looked for the first time the grotesque thing that it was .', 'but the clear colours of the plan were growing darker every moment .', 'the masses of rose or rhododendron deepened from crimson to violet .', 'the maze of gravel pathways faded from gold to brown .', 'by the time they had risen a few hundred feet higher nothing could be seen of that darkening landscape except the lines of lighted windows  each one of which  at least  was the light of one lost intelligence .', 'but on them as they swept upward better and braver winds seemed to blow  and on them the ruby light of evening seemed struck  and splashed like red spurts from the grapes of dionysus .', 'below them the fallen lights were literally the fallen stars of servitude .', 'and above them all the red and raging clouds were like the leaping flags of liberty .', 'the man with the cloven chin seemed to have a singular power of understanding thoughts  for  as turnbull felt the whole universe tilt and turn over his head  the stranger said exactly the right thing .', ' doesn  t it seem as if everything were being upset ', 'said he   and if once everything is upset  he will be upset on top of it .', 'then  as turnbull made no answer  his host continued ', ' that is the really fine thing about space .', 'it is topsy  turvy .', 'you have only to climb far enough towards the morning star to feel that you are coming down to it .', 'you have only to dive deep enough into the abyss to feel that you are rising .', 'that is the only glory of this universe  it is a giddy universe .', 'then  as turnbull was still silent  he added ', ' the heavens are full of revolution  of the real sort of revolution .', 'all the high things are sinking low and all the big things looking small .', 'all the people who think they are aspiring find they are falling head foremost .', 'and all the people who think they are condescending find they are climbing up a precipice .', 'that is the intoxication of space .', 'that is the only joy of eternity  doubt .', 'there is only one pleasure the angels can possibly have in flying  and that is  that they do not know whether they are on their head or their heels .', 'then  finding his companion still mute  he fell himself into a smiling and motionless meditation  at the end of which he said suddenly ', ' so macian converted you ', 'turnbull sprang up as if spurning the steel car from under his feet .', ' converted me ', 'he cried .', ' what the devil do you mean ', 'i have known him for a month  and i have not retracted a single ', ' this catholicism is a curious thing  said the man of the cloven chin in uninterrupted reflectiveness  leaning his elegant elbows over the edge of the vessel   it soaks and weakens men without their knowing it  just as i fear it has soaked and weakened you .', 'turnbull stood in an attitude which might well have meant pitching the other man out of the flying ship .', ' i am an atheist  he said  in a stifled voice .', ' i have always been an atheist .', 'i am still an atheist .', 'then  addressing the other  s indolent and indifferent back  he cried   in god  s name what do you mean ', 'and the other answered without turning round ', ' i mean nothing in god  s name .', 'turnbull spat over the edge of the car and fell back furiously into his seat .', 'the other continued still unruffled  and staring over the edge idly as an angler stares down at a stream .', ' the truth is that we never thought that you could have been caught  he said   we counted on you as the one red  hot revolutionary left in the world .', 'but  of course  these men like macian are awfully clever  especially when they pretend to be stupid .', 'turnbull leapt up again in a living fury and cried   what have i got to do with macian ', 'i believe all i ever believed  and disbelieve all i ever disbelieved .', 'what does all this mean  and what do you want with me here ', 'then for the first time the other lifted himself from the edge of the car and faced him .', ' i have brought you here  he answered   to take part in the last war of the world .', ' the last war ', 'repeated turnbull  even in his dazed state a little touchy about such a dogma   how do you know it will be the last ', 'the man laid himself back in his reposeful attitude  and said ', ' it is the last war  because if it does not cure the world for ever  it will destroy it .', ' what do you mean ', ' i only mean what you mean  answered the unknown in a temperate voice .', ' what was it that you always meant on those million and one nights when you walked outside your ludgate hill shop and shook your hand in the air ', ' still i do not see  said turnbull  stubbornly .', ' you will soon  said the other  and abruptly bent downward one iron handle of his huge machine .', 'the engine stopped  stooped  and dived almost as deliberately as a man bathing  in their downward rush they swept within fifty yards of a big bulk of stone that turnbull knew only too well .', 'the last red anger of the sunset was ended  the dome of heaven was dark  the lanes of flaring light in the streets below hardly lit up the base of the building .', 'but he saw that it was st . paul  s cathedral  and he saw that on the top of it the ball was still standing erect  but the cross was stricken and had fallen sideways .', 'then only he cared to look down into the streets  and saw that they were inflamed with uproar and tossing passions .', ' we arrive at a happy moment  said the man steering the ship .', ' the insurgents are bombarding the city  and a cannon  ball has just hit the cross .', 'many of the insurgents are simple people  and they naturally regard it as a happy omen .', ' quite so  said turnbull  in a rather colourless voice .', ' yes  replied the other .', ' i thought you would be glad to see your prayer answered .', 'of course i apologize for the word prayer .', ' don  t mention it  said turnbull .', 'the flying ship had come down upon a sort of curve  and was now rising again .', 'the higher and higher it rose the broader and broader became the scenes of flame and desolation underneath .', 'ludgate hill indeed had been an uncaptured and comparatively quiet height  altered only by the startling coincidence of the cross fallen awry .', 'all the other thoroughfares on all sides of that hill were full of the pulsation and the pain of battle  full of shaking torches and shouting faces .', 'when at length they had risen high enough to have a bird  s  eye view of the whole campaign  turnbull was already intoxicated .', 'he had smelt gunpowder  which was the incense of his own revolutionary religion .', ' have the people really risen ', 'he asked  breathlessly .', ' what are they fighting about ', ' the programme is rather elaborate  said his entertainer with some indifference .', ' i think dr . hertz drew it up .', 'turnbull wrinkled his forehead .', ' are all the poor people with the revolution ', 'he asked .', 'the other shrugged his shoulders .', ' all the instructed and class  conscious part of them without exception  he replied .', ' there were certainly a few districts  in fact  we are passing over them just now ', 'turnbull looked down and saw that the polished car was literally lit up from underneath by the far  flung fires from below .', 'underneath whole squares and solid districts were in flames  like prairies or forests on fire .', ' dr . hertz has convinced everybody  said turnbull  s cicerone in a smooth voice   that nothing can really be done with the real slums .', 'his celebrated maxim has been quite adopted .', 'i mean the three celebrated sentences   no man should be unemployed .', 'employ the employables .', 'destroy the unemployables .', 'there was a silence  and then turnbull said in a rather strained voice   and do i understand that this good work is going on under here ', ' going on splendidly  replied his companion in the heartiest voice .', ' you see  these people were much too tired and weak even to join the social war .', 'they were a definite hindrance to it .', ' and so you are simply burning them out ', ' it does seem absurdly simple  said the man  with a beaming smile   when one thinks of all the worry and talk about helping a hopeless slave population  when the future obviously was only crying to be rid of them .', 'there are happy babes unborn ready to burst the doors when these drivellers are swept away .', ' will you permit me to say  said turnbull  after reflection   that i don  t like all this ', ' and will you permit me to say  said the other  with a snap   that i don  t like mr . evan macian ', 'somewhat to the speaker  s surprise this did not inflame the sensitive sceptic  he had the air of thinking thoroughly  and then he said   no  i don  t think it  s my friend macian that taught me that .', 'i think i should always have said that i don  t like this .', 'these people have rights .', ' rights ', 'repeated the unknown in a tone quite indescribable .', 'then he added with a more open sneer   perhaps they also have souls .', ' they have lives ', 'said turnbull  sternly   that is quite enough for me .', 'i understood you to say that you thought life sacred .', ' yes  indeed ', 'cried his mentor with a sort of idealistic animation .', ' yes  indeed ', 'life is sacred  but lives are not sacred .', 'we are improving life by removing lives .', 'can you  as a free  thinker  find any fault in that ', ' yes  said turnbull with brevity .', ' yet you applaud tyrannicide  said the stranger with rationalistic gaiety .', ' how inconsistent ', 'it really comes to this  you approve of taking away life from those to whom it is a triumph and a pleasure .', 'but you will not take away life from those to whom it is a burden and a toil .', 'turnbull rose to his feet in the car with considerable deliberation  but his face seemed oddly pale .', 'the other went on with enthusiasm .', ' life  yes  life is indeed sacred ', 'he cried   but new lives for old ', 'good lives for bad ', 'on that very place where now there sprawls one drunken wastrel of a pavement artist more or less wishing he were dead  on that very spot there shall in the future be living pictures  there shall be golden girls and boys leaping in the sun .', 'turnbull  still standing up  opened his lips .', ' will you put me down  please ', 'he said  quite calmly  like on stopping an omnibus .', ' put you down  what do you mean ', 'cried his leader .', ' i am taking you to the front of the revolutionary war  where you will be one of the first of the revolutionary leaders .', ' thank you  replied turnbull with the same painful constraint .', ' i have heard about your revolutionary war  and i think on the whole that i would rather be anywhere else .', ' do you want to be taken to a monastery  snarled the other   with macian and his winking madonnas .', ' i want to be taken to a madhouse  said turnbull distinctly  giving the direction with a sort of precision .', ' i want to go back to exactly the same lunatic asylum from which i came .', ' why ', 'asked the unknown .', ' because i want a little sane and wholesome society  answered turnbull .', 'there was a long and peculiar silence  and then the man driving the flying machine said quite coolly   i won  t take you back .', 'and then turnbull said equally coolly   then i  ll jump out of the car .', 'the unknown rose to his full height  and the expression in his eyes seemed to be made of ironies behind ironies  as two mirrors infinitely reflect each other .', 'at last he said  very gravely   do you think i am the devil ', ' yes  said turnbull  violently .', ' for i think the devil is a dream  and so are you .', 'i don  t believe in you or your flying ship or your last fight of the world .', 'it is all a nightmare .', 'i say as a fact of dogma and faith that it is all a nightmare .', 'and i will be a martyr for my faith as much as st . catherine  for i will jump out of this ship and risk waking up safe in bed .', 'after swaying twice with the swaying vessel he dived over the side as one dives into the sea .', 'for some incredible moments stars and space and planets seemed to shoot up past him as the sparks fly upward  and yet in that sickening descent he was full of some unnatural happiness .', 'he could connect it with no idea except one that half escaped him  what evan had said of the difference between christ and satan  that it was by christ  s own choice that he descended into hell .', 'when he again realized anything  he was lying on his elbow on the lawn of the lunatic asylum  and the last red of the sunset had not yet disappeared .', 'xvii .', 'the idiot', 'evan macian was standing a few yards off looking at him in absolute silence .', 'he had not the moral courage to ask macian if there had been anything astounding in the manner of his coming there  nor did macian seem to have any question to ask  or perhaps any need to ask it .', 'the two men came slowly towards each other  and found the same expression on each other  s faces .', 'then  for the first time in all their acquaintance  they shook hands .', 'almost as if this were a kind of unconscious signal  it brought dr . quayle bounding out of a door and running across the lawn .', ' oh  there you are ', 'he exclaimed with a relieved giggle .', ' will you come inside  please ', 'i want to speak to you both .', 'they followed him into his shiny wooden office where their damning record was kept .', 'dr . quayle sat down on a swivel chair and swung round to face them .', 'his carved smile had suddenly disappeared .', ' i will be plain with you gentlemen  he said  abruptly   you know quite well we do our best for everybody here .', 'your cases have been under special consideration  and the master himself has decided that you ought to be treated specially and  er  under somewhat simpler conditions .', ' you mean treated worse  i suppose  said turnbull  gruffly .', 'the doctor did not reply  and macian said   i expected this .', 'his eyes had begun to glow .', 'the doctor answered  looking at his desk and playing with a key   well  in certain cases that give anxiety  it is often better ', ' give anxiety  said turnbull  fiercely .', ' confound your impudence ', 'what do you mean ', 'you imprison two perfectly sane men in a madhouse because you have made up a long word .', 'they take it in good temper  walk and talk in your garden like monks who have found a vocation  are civil even to you  you damned druggists  hack ', 'behave not only more sanely than any of your patients  but more sanely than half the sane men outside  and you have the soul  stifling cheek to say that they give anxiety .', ' the head of the asylum has settled it all  said dr . quayle  still looking down .', 'macian took one of his immense strides forward and stood over the doctor with flaming eyes .', ' if the head has settled it let the head announce it  he said .', ' i won  t take it from you .', 'i believe you to be a low  gibbering degenerate .', 'let us see the head of the asylum .', ' see the head of the asylum  repeated dr . quayle .', ' certainly not .', 'the tall highlander  bending over him  put one hand on his shoulder with fatherly interest .', ' you don  t seem to appreciate the peculiar advantages of my position as a lunatic  he said .', ' i could kill you with my left hand before such a rat as you could so much as squeak .', 'and i wouldn  t be hanged for it .', ' i certainly agree with mr . macian  said turnbull with sobriety and perfect respectfulness   that you had better let us see the head of the institution .', 'dr . quayle got to his feet in a mixture of sudden hysteria and clumsy presence of mind .', ' oh  certainly  he said with a weak laugh .', ' you can see the head of the asylum if you particularly want to .', 'he almost ran out of the room  and the two followed swiftly on his flying coat tails .', 'he knocked at an ordinary varnished door in the corridor .', 'when a voice said   come in  macian  s breath went hissing back through his teeth into his chest .', 'turnbull was more impetuous  and opened the door .', 'it was a neat and well  appointed room entirely lined with a medical library .', 'at the other end of it was a ponderous and polished desk with an incandescent lamp on it  the light of which was just sufficient to show a slender  well  bred figure in an ordinary medical black frock  coat  whose head  quite silvered with age  was bent over neat piles of notes .', 'this gentleman looked up for an instant as they entered  and the lamplight fell on his glittering spectacles and long  clean  shaven face  a face which would have been simply like an aristocrat  s but that a certain lion poise of the head and long cleft in the chin made it look more like a very handsome actor  s .', 'it was only for a flash that his face was thus lifted .', 'then he bent his silver head over his notes once more  and said  without looking up again ', ' i told you  dr . quayle  that these men were to go to cells b and c .', 'turnbull and macian looked at each other  and said more than they could ever say with tongues or swords .', 'among other things they said that to that particular head of the institution it was a waste of time to appeal  and they followed dr . quayle out of the room .', 'the instant they stepped out into the corridor four sturdy figures stepped from four sides  pinioned them  and ran them along the galleries .', 'they might very likely have thrown their captors right and left had they been inclined to resist  but for some nameless reason they were more inclined to laugh .', 'a mixture of mad irony with childish curiosity made them feel quite inclined to see what next twist would be taken by their imbecile luck .', 'they were dragged down countless cold avenues lined with glazed tiles  different only in being of different lengths and set at different angles .', 'they were so many and so monotonous that to escape back by them would have been far harder than fleeing from the hampton court maze .', 'only the fact that windows grew fewer  coming at longer intervals  and the fact that when the windows did come they seemed shadowed and let in less light  showed that they were winding into the core or belly of some enormous building .', 'after a little time the glazed corridors began to be lit by electricity .', 'at last  when they had walked nearly a mile in those white and polished tunnels  they came with quite a shock to the futile finality of a cul  de  sac .', 'all that white and weary journey ended suddenly in an oblong space and a blank white wall .', 'but in the white wall there were two iron doors painted white on which were written  respectively  in neat black capitals b and c .', ' you go in here  sir  said the leader of the officials  quite respectfully   and you in here .', 'but before the doors had clanged upon their dazed victims  macian had been able to say to turnbull with a strange drawl of significance   i wonder who a is .', 'turnbull made an automatic struggle before he allowed himself to be thrown into the cell .', 'hence it happened that he was the last to enter  and was still full of the exhilaration of the adventures for at least five minutes after the echo of the clanging door had died away .', 'then  when silence had sunk deep and nothing happened for two and a half hours  it suddenly occurred to him that this was the end of his life .', 'he was hidden and sealed up in this little crack of stone until the flesh should fall off his bones .', 'he was dead  and the world had won .', 'his cell was of an oblong shape  but very long in comparison with its width .', 'it was just wide enough to permit the arms to be fully extended with the dumb  bells  which were hung up on the left wall  very dusty .', 'it was  however  long enough for a man to walk one thirty  fifth part of a mile if he traversed it entirely .', 'on the same principle a row of fixed holes  quite close together  let in to the cells by pipes what was alleged to be the freshest air .', 'for these great scientific organizers insisted that a man should be healthy even if he was miserable .', 'they provided a walk long enough to give him exercise and holes large enough to give him oxygen .', 'there their interest in human nature suddenly ceased .', 'it seemed never to have occurred to them that the benefit of exercise belongs partly to the benefit of liberty .', 'they had not entertained the suggestion that the open air is only one of the advantages of the open sky .', 'they administered air in secret  but in sufficient doses  as if it were a medicine .', 'they suggested walking  as if no man had ever felt inclined to walk .', 'above all  the asylum authorities insisted on their own extraordinary cleanliness .', 'every morning  while turnbull was still half asleep on his iron bedstead which was lifted half  way up the wall and clamped to it with iron  four sluices or metal mouths opened above him at the four corners of the chamber and washed it white of any defilement .', 'turnbull  s solitary soul surged up against this sickening daily solemnity .', ' i am buried alive ', 'he cried  bitterly   they have hidden me under mountains .', 'i shall be here till i rot .', 'why the blazes should it matter to them whether i am dirty or clean .', 'every morning and evening an iron hatchway opened in his oblong cell  and a brown hairy hand or two thrust in a plate of perfectly cooked lentils and a big bowl of cocoa .', 'he was not underfed any more than he was underexercised or asphyxiated .', 'he had ample walking space  ample air  ample and even filling food .', 'the only objection was that he had nothing to walk towards  nothing to feast about  and no reason whatever for drawing the breath of life .', 'even the shape of his cell especially irritated him .', 'it was a long  narrow parallelogram  which had a flat wall at one end and ought to have had a flat wall at the other  but that end was broken by a wedge or angle of space  like the prow of a ship .', 'after three days of silence and cocoa  this angle at the end began to infuriate turnbull .', 'it maddened him to think that two lines came together and pointed at nothing .', 'after the fifth day he was reckless  and poked his head into the corner .', 'after twenty  five days he almost broke his head against it .', 'then he became quite cool and stupid again  and began to examine it like a sort of robinson crusoe .', 'almost unconsciously it was his instinct to examine outlets  and he found himself paying particular attention to the row of holes which let in the air into his last house of life .', 'he soon discovered that these air  holes were all the ends and mouths of long leaden tubes which doubtless carried air from some remote watering  place near margate .', 'one evening while he was engaged in the fifth investigation he noticed something like twilight in one of these dumb mouths  as compared with the darkness of the others .', 'thrusting his finger in as far as it would go  he found a hole and flapping edge in the tube .', 'this he rent open and instantly saw a light behind  it was at least certain that he had struck some other cell .', 'it is a characteristic of all things now called  efficient  which means mechanical and calculated  that if they go wrong at all they go entirely wrong .', 'there is no power of retrieving a defeat  as in simpler and more living organisms .', 'a strong gun can conquer a strong elephant  but a wounded elephant can easily conquer a broken gun .', 'thus the prussian monarchy in the eighteenth century  or now  can make a strong army merely by making the men afraid .', 'but it does it with the permanent possibility that the men may some day be more afraid of their enemies than of their officers .', 'thus the drainage in our cities so long as it is quite solid means a general safety  but if there is one leak it means concentrated poison  an explosion of deathly germs like dynamite  a spirit of stink .', 'thus  indeed  all that excellent machinery which is the swiftest thing on earth in saving human labour is also the slowest thing on earth in resisting human interference .', 'it may be easier to get chocolate for nothing out of a shopkeeper than out of an automatic machine .', 'but if you did manage to steal the chocolate  the automatic machine would be much less likely to run after you .', 'turnbull was not long in discovering this truth in connexion with the cold and colossal machinery of this great asylum .', 'he had been shaken by many spiritual states since the instant when he was pitched head foremost into that private cell which was to be his private room till death .', 'he had felt a high fit of pride and poetry  which had ebbed away and left him deadly cold .', 'he had known a period of mere scientific curiosity  in the course of which he examined all the tiles of his cell  with the gratifying conclusion that they were all the same shape and size  but was greatly puzzled about the angle in the wall at the end  and also about an iron peg or spike that stood out from the wall  the object of which he does not know to this day .', 'then he had a period of mere madness not to be written of by decent men  but only by those few dirty novelists hallooed on by the infernal huntsman to hunt down and humiliate human nature .', 'this also passed  but left behind it a feverish distaste for many of the mere objects around him .', 'long after he had returned to sanity and such hopeless cheerfulness as a man might have on a desert island  he disliked the regular squares of the pattern of wall and floor and the triangle that terminated his corridor .', 'above all  he had a hatred  deep as the hell he did not believe in  for the objectless iron peg in the wall .', 'but in all his moods  sane or insane  intolerant or stoical  he never really doubted this  that the machine held him as light and as hopelessly as he had from his birth been held by the hopeless cosmos of his own creed .', 'he knew well the ruthless and inexhaustible resources of our scientific civilization .', 'he no more expected rescue from a medical certificate than rescue from the solar system .', 'in many of his robinson crusoe moods he thought kindly of macian as of some quarrelsome school  fellow who had long been dead .', 'he thought of leaving in the cell when he died a rigid record of his opinions  and when he began to write them down on scraps of envelope in his pocket  he was startled to discover how much they had changed .', 'then he remembered the beauchamp tower  and tried to write his blazing scepticism on the wall  and discovered that it was all shiny tiles on which nothing could be either drawn or carved .', 'then for an instant there hung and broke above him like a high wave the whole horror of scientific imprisonment  which manages to deny a man not only liberty  but every accidental comfort of bondage .', 'in the old filthy dungeons men could carve their prayers or protests in the rock .', 'here the white and slippery walls escaped even from bearing witness .', 'the old prisoners could make a pet of a mouse or a beetle strayed out of a hole .', 'here the unpierceable walls were washed every morning by an automatic sluice .', 'there was no natural corruption and no merciful decay by which a living thing could enter in .', 'then james turnbull looked up and saw the high invincible hatefulness of the society in which he lived  and saw the hatefulness of something else also  which he told himself again and again was not the cosmos in which he believed .', 'but all the time he had never once doubted that the five sides of his cell were for him the wall of the world henceforward  and it gave him a shock of surprise even to discover the faint light through the aperture in the ventilation tube .', 'but he had forgotten how close efficiency has to pack everything together and how easily  therefore  a pipe here or there may leak .', 'turnbull thrust his first finger down the aperture  and at last managed to make a slight further fissure in the piping .', 'the light that came up from beyond was very faint  and apparently indirect  it seemed to fall from some hole or window higher up .', 'as he was screwing his eye to peer at this grey and greasy twilight he was astonished to see another human finger very long and lean come down from above towards the broken pipe and hook it up to something higher .', 'the lighted aperture was abruptly blackened and blocked  presumably by a face and mouth  for something human spoke down the tube  though the words were not clear .', ' who is that ', 'asked turnbull  trembling with excitement  yet wary and quite resolved not to spoil any chance .', 'after a few indistinct sounds the voice came down with a strong argyllshire accent ', ' i say  turnbull  we couldn  t fight through this tube  could we ', 'sentiments beyond speech surged up in turnbull and silenced him for a space just long enough to be painful .', 'then he said with his old gaiety   i vote we talk a little first  i don  t want to murder the first man i have met for ten million years .', ' i know what you mean  answered the other .', ' it has been awful .', 'for a mortal month i have been alone with god .', 'turnbull started  and it was on the tip of his tongue to answer   alone with god ', 'then you do not know what loneliness is .', 'but he answered  after all  in his old defiant style   alone with god  were you ', 'and i suppose you found his majesty  s society rather monotonous ', ' oh  no  said macian  and his voice shuddered   it was a great deal too exciting .', 'after a very long silence the voice of macian said   what do you really hate most in your place ', ' you  d think i was really mad if i told you  answered turnbull  bitterly .', ' then i expect it  s the same as mine  said the other voice .', ' i am sure it  s not the same as anybody  s  said turnbull   for it has no rhyme or reason .', 'perhaps my brain really has gone  but i detest that iron spike in the left wall more than the damned desolation or the damned cocoa .', 'have you got one in your cell ', ' not now  replied macian with serenity .', ' i  ve pulled it out .', 'his fellow  prisoner could only repeat the words .', ' i pulled it out the other day when i was off my head  continued the tranquil highland voice .', ' it looked so unnecessary .', ' you must be ghastly strong  said turnbull .', ' one is  when one is mad  was the careless reply   and it had worn a little loose in the socket .', 'even now i  ve got it out i can  t discover what it was for .', 'but i  ve found out something a long sight funnier .', ' what do you mean ', 'asked turnbull .', ' i have found out where a is  said the other .', 'three weeks afterwards macian had managed to open up communications which made his meaning plain .', 'by that time the two captives had fully discovered and demonstrated that weakness in the very nature of modern machinery to which we have already referred .', 'the very fact that they were isolated from all companions meant that they were free from all spies  and as there were no gaolers to be bribed  so there were none to be baffled .', 'machinery brought them their cocoa and cleaned their cells  that machinery was as helpless as it was pitiless .', 'a little patient violence  conducted day after day amid constant mutual suggestion  opened an irregular hole in the wall  large enough to let in a small man  in the exact place where there had been before the tiny ventilation holes .', 'turnbull tumbled somehow into macian  s apartment  and his first glance found out that the iron spike was indeed plucked from its socket  and left  moreover  another ragged hole into some hollow place behind .', 'but for this macian  s cell was the duplicate of turnbull  s  a long oblong ending in a wedge and lined with cold and lustrous tiles .', 'the small hole from which the peg had been displaced was in that short oblique wall at the end nearest to turnbull  s .', 'that individual looked at it with a puzzled face .', ' what is in there ', 'he asked .', 'macian answered briefly   another cell .', ' but where can the door of it be ', 'said his companion  even more puzzled   the doors of our cells are at the other end .', ' it has no door  said evan .', 'in the pause of perplexity that followed  an eerie and sinister feeling crept over turnbull  s stubborn soul in spite of himself .', 'the notion of the doorless room chilled him with that sense of half  witted curiosity which one has when something horrible is half understood .', ' james turnbull  said macian  in a low and shaken voice   these people hate us more than nero hated christians  and fear us more than any man feared nero .', 'they have filled england with frenzy and galloping in order to capture us and wipe us out  in order to kill us .', 'and they have killed us  for you and i have only made a hole in our coffins .', 'but though this hatred that they felt for us is bigger than they felt for bonaparte  and more plain and practical than they would feel for jack the ripper  yet it is not we whom the people of this place hate most .', 'a cold and quivering impatience continued to crawl up turnbull  s spine  he had never felt so near to superstition and supernaturalism  and it was not a pretty sort of superstition either .', ' there is another man more fearful and hateful  went on macian  in his low monotone voice   and they have buried him even deeper .', 'god knows how they did it  for he was let in by neither door nor window  nor lowered through any opening above .', 'i expect these iron handles that we both hate have been part of some damned machinery for walling him up .', 'he is there .', 'i have looked through the hole at him  but i cannot stand looking at him long  because his face is turned away from me and he does not move .', 'al turnbull  s unnatural and uncompleted feelings found their outlet in rushing to the aperture and looking into the unknown room .', 'it was a third oblong cell exactly like the other two except that it was doorless  and except that on one of the walls was painted a large black a like the b and c outside their own doors .', 'the letter in this case was not painted outside  because this prison had no outside .', 'on the same kind of tiled floor  of which the monotonous squares had maddened turnbull  s eye and brain  was sitting a figure which was startlingly short even for a child  only that the enormous head was ringed with hair of a frosty grey .', 'the figure was draped  both insecurely and insufficiently  in what looked like the remains of a brown flannel dressing  gown  an emptied cup of cocoa stood on the floor beside it  and the creature had his big grey head cocked at a particular angle of inquiry or attention which amid all that gathering gloom and mystery struck one as comic if not cocksure .', 'after six still seconds turnbull could stand it no longer  but called out to the dwarfish thing  in what words heaven knows .', 'the thing got up with the promptitude of an animal  and turning round offered the spectacle of two owlish eyes and a huge grey  and  white beard not unlike the plumage of an owl .', 'this extraordinary beard covered him literally to his feet  not that that was very far  and perhaps it was as well that it did  for portions of his remaining clothing seemed to fall off whenever he moved .', 'one talks trivially of a face like parchment  but this old man  s face was so wrinkled that it was like a parchment loaded with hieroglyphics .', 'the lines of his face were so deep and complex that one could see five or ten different faces besides the real one  as one can see them in an elaborate wall  paper .', 'and yet while his face seemed like a scripture older than the gods  his eyes were quite bright  blue  and startled like those of a baby .', 'they looked as if they had only an instant before been fitted into his head .', 'everything depended so obviously upon whether this buried monster spoke that turnbull did not know or care whether he himself had spoken .', 'he said something or nothing .', 'and then he waited for this dwarfish voice that had been hidden under the mountains of the world .', 'at last it did speak  and spoke in english  with a foreign accent that was neither latin nor teutonic .', 'he suddenly stretched out a long and very dirty forefinger  and cried in a voice of clear recognition  like a child  s   that  s a hole .', 'he digested the discovery for some seconds  sucking his finger  and then he cried  with a crow of laughter   and that  s a head come through it .', 'the hilarious energy in this idiot attitude gave turnbull another sick turn .', 'he had grown to tolerate those dreary and mumbling madmen who trailed themselves about the beautiful asylum gardens .', 'but there was something new and subversive of the universe in the combination of so much cheerful decision with a body without a brain .', ' why did they put you in such a place ', 'he asked at last with embarrassment .', ' good place .', 'yes  said the old man  nodding a great many times and beaming like a flattered landlord .', ' good shape .', 'long and narrow  with a point .', 'like this  and he made lovingly with his hands a map of the room in the air .', ' but that  s not the best  he added  confidentially .', ' squares very good  i have a nice long holiday  and can count them .', 'but that  s not the best .', ' what is the best ', 'asked turnbull in great distress .', ' spike is the best  said the old man  opening his blue eyes blazing   it sticks out .', 'the words turnbull spoke broke out of him in pure pity .', ' can  t we do anything for you ', 'he said .', ' i am very happy  said the other  alphabetically .', ' you are a good man .', 'can i help you ', ' no  i don  t think you can  sir  said turnbull with rough pathos   i am glad you are contented at least .', 'the weird old person opened his broad blue eyes and fixed turnbull with a stare extraordinarily severe .', ' you are quite sure  he said   i cannot help you ', ' quite sure  thank you  said turnbull with broken brevity .', ' good day .', 'then he turned to macian who was standing close behind him  and whose face  now familiar in all its moods  told him easily that evan had heard the whole of the strange dialogue .', ' curse those cruel beasts ', 'cried turnbull .', ' they  ve turned him to an imbecile just by burying him alive .', 'his brain  s like a pin  point now .', ' you are sure he is a lunatic ', 'said evan  slowly .', ' not a lunatic  said turnbull   an idiot .', 'he just points to things and says that they stick out .', ' he had a notion that he could help us  said macian moodily  and began to pace towards the other end of his cell .', ' yes  it was a bit pathetic  assented turnbull   such a thing offering help  and besides  hallo ', 'hallo ', 'what  s the matter ', ' god almighty guide us all ', 'said macian .', 'he was standing heavy and still at the other end of the room and staring quietly at the door which for thirty days had sealed them up from the sun .', 'turnbull  following the other  s eye  stared at the door likewise  and then he also uttered an exclamation .', 'the iron door was standing about an inch and a half open .', ' he said  began evan  in a trembling voice  he offered ', ' come along  you fool ', 'shouted turnbull with a sudden and furious energy .', ' i see it all now  and it  s the best stroke of luck in the world .', 'you pulled out that iron handle that had screwed up his cell  and it somehow altered the machinery and opened all the doors .', 'seizing macian by the elbow he bundled him bodily out into the open corridor and ran him on till they saw daylight through a half  darkened window .', ' all the same  said evan  like one answering in an ordinary conversation   he did ask you whether he could help you .', 'all this wilderness of windowless passages was so built into the heart of that fortress of fear that it seemed more than an hour before the fugitives had any good glimpse of the outer world .', 'they did not even know what hour of the day it was  and when  turning a corner  they saw the bare tunnel of the corridor end abruptly in a shining square of garden  the grass burning in that strong evening sunshine which makes it burnished gold rather than green  the abrupt opening on to the earth seemed like a hole knocked in the wall of heaven .', 'only once or twice in life is it permitted to a man thus to see the very universe from outside  and feel existence itself as an adorable adventure not yet begun .', 'as they found this shining escape out of that hellish labyrinth they both had simultaneously the sensation of being babes unborn  of being asked by god if they would like to live upon the earth .', 'they were looking in at one of the seven gates of eden .', 'turnbull was the first to leap into the garden  with an earth  spurning leap like that of one who could really spread his wings and fly .', 'macian  who came an instant after  was less full of mere animal gusto and fuller of a more fearful and quivering pleasure in the clear and innocent flower colours and the high and holy trees .', 'with one bound they were in that cool and cleared landscape  and they found just outside the door the black  clad gentleman with the cloven chin smilingly regarding them  and his chin seemed to grow longer and longer as he smiled .', 'xviii .', 'a riddle of faces', 'just behind him stood two other doctors  one  the familiar dr . quayle  of the blinking eyes and bleating voice  the other  a more commonplace but much more forcible figure  a stout young doctor with short  well  brushed hair and a round but resolute face .', 'at the sight of the escape these two subordinates uttered a cry and sprang forward  but their superior remained motionless and smiling  and somehow the lack of his support seemed to arrest and freeze them in the very gesture of pursuit .', ' let them be  he cried in a voice that cut like a blade of ice  and not only of ice  but of some awful primordial ice that had never been water .', ' i want no devoted champions  said the cutting voice   even the folly of one  s friends bores one at last .', 'you don  t suppose i should have let these lunatics out of their cells without good reason .', 'i have the best and fullest reason .', 'they can be let out of their cell today  because today the whole world has become their cell .', 'i will have no more medieval mummery of chains and doors .', 'let them wander about the earth as they wandered about this garden  and i shall still be their easy master .', 'let them take the wings of the morning and abide in the uttermost parts of the sea  i am there .', 'whither shall they go from my presence and whither shall they flee from my spirit ', 'courage  dr . quayle  and do not be downhearted  the real days of tyranny are only beginning on this earth .', 'and with that the master laughed and swung away from them  almost as if his laugh was a bad thing for people to see .', ' might i speak to you a moment ', 'said turnbull  stepping forward with a respectful resolution .', 'but the shoulders of the master only seemed to take on a new and unexpected angle of mockery as he strode away .', 'turnbull swung round with great abruptness to the other two doctors  and said  harshly   what in snakes does he mean  and who are you ', ' my name is hutton  said the short  stout man   and i am  well  one of those whose business it is to uphold this establishment .', ' my name is turnbull  said the other   i am one of those whose business it is to tear it to the ground .', 'the small doctor smiled  and turnbull  s anger seemed suddenly to steady him .', ' but i don  t want to talk about that  he said  calmly   i only want to know what the master of this asylum really means .', 'dr . hutton  s smile broke into a laugh which  short as it was  had the suspicion of a shake in it .', ' i suppose you think that quite a simple question  he said .', ' i think it a plain question  said turnbull   and one that deserves a plain answer .', 'why did the master lock us up in a couple of cupboards like jars of pickles for a mortal month  and why does he now let us walk free in the garden again ', ' i understand  said hutton  with arched eyebrows   that your complaint is that you are now free to walk in the garden .', ' my complaint is  said turnbull  stubbornly   that if i am fit to walk freely now  i have been as fit for the last month .', 'no one has examined me  no one has come near me .', 'your chief says that i am only free because he has made other arrangements .', 'what are those arrangements ', 'the young man with the round face looked down for a little while and smoked reflectively .', 'the other and elder doctor had gone pacing nervously by himself upon the lawn .', 'at length the round face was lifted again  and showed two round blue eyes with a certain frankness in them .', ' well  i don  t see that it can do any harm to tell you know  he said .', ' you were shut up just then because it was just during that month that the master was bringing off his big scheme .', 'he was getting his bill through parliament  and organizing the new medical police .', 'but of course you haven  t heard of all that  in fact  you weren  t meant to .', ' heard of all what ', 'asked the impatient inquirer .', ' there  s a new law now  and the asylum powers are greatly extended .', 'even if you did escape now  any policeman would take you up in the next town if you couldn  t show a certificate of sanity from us .', ' well  continued dr . hutton   the master described before both houses of parliament the real scientific objection to all existing legislation about lunacy .', 'as he very truly said  the mistake was in supposing insanity to be merely an exception or an extreme .', 'insanity  like forgetfulness  is simply a quality which enters more or less into all human beings  and for practical purposes it is more necessary to know whose mind is really trustworthy than whose has some accidental taint .', 'we have therefore reversed the existing method  and people now have to prove that they are sane .', 'in the first village you entered  the village constable would notice that you were not wearing on the left lapel of your coat the small pewter s which is now necessary to any one who walks about beyond asylum bounds or outside asylum hours .', ' you mean to say  said turnbull   that this was what the master of the asylum urged before the house of commons ', 'dr . hutton nodded with gravity .', ' and you mean to say  cried turnbull  with a vibrant snort   that that proposal was passed in an assembly that calls itself democratic ', 'the doctor showed his whole row of teeth in a smile .', ' oh  the assembly calls itself socialist now  he said   but we explained to them that this was a question for men of science .', 'turnbull gave one stamp upon the gravel  then pulled himself together  and resumed   but why should your infernal head medicine  man lock us up in separate cells while he was turning england into a madhouse ', 'i  m not the prime minister  we  re not the house of lords .', ' he wasn  t afraid of the prime minister  replied dr . hutton   he isn  t afraid of the house of lords .', 'but ', ' well ', 'inquired turnbull  stamping again .', ' he is afraid of you  said hutton  simply .', ' why  didn  t you know ', 'macian  who had not spoken yet  made one stride forward and stood with shaking limbs and shining eyes .', ' he was afraid ', 'began evan  thickly .', ' you mean to say that we ', ' i mean to say the plain truth now that the danger is over  said hutton  calmly   most certainly you two were the only people he ever was afraid of .', 'then he added in a low but not inaudible voice   except one  whom he feared worse  and has buried deeper .', ' come away  cried macian   this has to be thought about .', 'turnbull followed him in silence as he strode away  but just before he vanished  turned and spoke again to the doctors .', ' but what has got hold of people ', 'he asked  abruptly .', ' why should all england have gone dotty on the mere subject of dottiness ', 'dr . hutton smiled his open smile once more and bowed slightly .', ' as to that also  he replied   i don  t want to make you vain .', 'turnbull swung round without a word  and he and his companion were lost in the lustrous leafage of the garden .', 'they noticed nothing special about the scene  except that the garden seemed more exquisite than ever in the deepening sunset  and that there seemed to be many more people  whether patients or attendants  walking about in it .', 'from behind the two black  coated doctors as they stood on the lawn another figure somewhat similarly dressed strode hurriedly past them  having also grizzled hair and an open flapping frock  coat .', 'both his decisive step and dapper black array marked him out as another medical man  or at least a man in authority  and as he passed turnbull the latter was aroused by a strong impression of having seen the man somewhere before .', 'it was no one that he knew well  yet he was certain that it was someone at whom he had at sometime or other looked steadily .', 'it was neither the face of a friend nor of an enemy  it aroused neither irritation nor tenderness  yet it was a face which had for some reason been of great importance in his life .', 'turning and returning  and making detours about the garden  he managed to study the man  s face again and again  a moustached  somewhat military face with a monocle  the sort of face that is aristocratic without being distinguished .', 'turnbull could not remember any particular doctors in his decidedly healthy existence .', 'was the man a long  lost uncle  or was he only somebody who had sat opposite him regularly in a railway train ', 'at that moment the man knocked down his own eye  glass with a gesture of annoyance  turnbull remembered the gesture  and the truth sprang up solid in front of him .', 'the man with the moustaches was cumberland vane  the london police magistrate before whom he and macian had once stood on their trial .', 'the magistrate must have been transferred to some other official duties  to something connected with the inspection of asylums .', 'turnbull  s heart gave a leap of excitement which was half hope .', 'as a magistrate mr . cumberland vane had been somewhat careless and shallow  but certainly kindly  and not inaccessible to common sense so long as it was put to him in strictly conventional language .', 'he was at least an authority of a more human and refreshing sort than the crank with the wagging beard or the fiend with the forked chin .', 'he went straight up to the magistrate  and said   good evening  mr . vane  i doubt if you remember me .', 'cumberland vane screwed the eye  glass into his scowling face for an instant  and then said curtly but not uncivilly   yes  i remember you  sir  assault or battery  wasn  t it  a fellow broke your window .', 'a tall fellow  mcsomething  case made rather a noise afterwards .', ' macian is the name  sir  said turnbull  respectfully   i have him here with me .', ' eh ', 'said vane very sharply .', ' confound him ', 'has he got anything to do with this game ', ' mr . vane  said turnbull  pacifically   i will not pretend that either he or i acted quite decorously on that occasion .', 'you were very lenient with us  and did not treat us as criminals when you very well might .', 'so i am sure you will give us your testimony that  even if we were criminals  we are not lunatics in any legal or medical sense whatever .', 'i am sure you will use your influence for us .', ' my influence ', 'repeated the magistrate  with a slight start .', ' i don  t quite understand you .', ' i don  t know in what capacity you are here  continued turnbull  gravely   but a legal authority of your distinction must certainly be here in an important one .', 'whether you are visiting and inspecting the place  or attached to it as some kind of permanent legal adviser  your opinion must still ', 'cumberland vane exploded with a detonation of oaths  his face was transfigured with fury and contempt  and yet in some odd way he did not seem specially angry with turnbull .', ' but lord bless us and save us ', 'he gasped  at length   i  m not here as an official at all .', 'i  m here as a patient .', 'the cursed pack of rat  catching chemists all say that i  ve lost my wits .', ' you ', 'cried turnbull with terrible emphasis .', ' you ', 'lost your wits ', 'in the rush of his real astonishment at this towering unreality turnbull almost added   why  you haven  t got any to lose .', 'but he fortunately remembered the remains of his desperate diplomacy .', ' this can  t go on  he said  positively .', ' men like macian and i may suffer unjustly all our lives  but a man like you must have influence .', ' there is only one man who has any influence in england now  said vane  and his high voice fell to a sudden and convincing quietude .', ' whom do you mean ', 'asked turnbull .', ' i mean that cursed fellow with the long split chin  said the other .', ' is it really true  asked turnbull   that he has been allowed to buy up and control such a lot ', 'what put the country into such a state ', 'mr . cumberland vane laughed outright .', ' what put the country into such a state ', 'he asked .', ' why  you did .', 'when you were fool enough to agree to fight macian  after all  everybody was ready to believe that the bank of england might paint itself pink with white spots .', ' i don  t understand  answered turnbull .', ' why should you be surprised at my fighting ', 'i hope i have always fought .', ' well  said cumberland vane  airily   you didn  t believe in religion  you see  so we thought you were safe at any rate .', 'you went further in your language than most of us wanted to go  no good in just hurting one  s mother  s feelings  i think .', 'but of course we all knew you were right  and  really  we relied on you .', ' did you ', 'said the editor of the atheist with a bursting heart .', ' i am sorry you did not tell me so at the time .', 'he walked away very rapidly and flung himself on a garden seat  and for some six minutes his own wrongs hid from him the huge and hilarious fact that cumberland vane had been locked up as a lunatic .', 'the garden of the madhouse was so perfectly planned  and answered so exquisitely to every hour of daylight  that one could almost fancy that the sunlight was caught there tangled in its tinted trees  as the wise men of gotham tried to chain the spring to a bush .', 'or it seemed as if this ironic paradise still kept its unique dawn or its special sunset while the rest of the earthly globe rolled through its ordinary hours .', 'there was one evening  or late afternoon  in particular  which evan macian will remember in the last moments of death .', 'it was what artists call a daffodil sky  but it is coarsened even by reference to a daffodil .', 'it was of that innocent lonely yellow which has never heard of orange  though it might turn quite unconsciously into green .', 'against it the tops  one might say the turrets  of the clipt and ordered trees were outlined in that shade of veiled violet which tints the tops of lavender .', 'a white early moon was hardly traceable upon that delicate yellow .', 'macian  i say  will remember this tender and transparent evening  partly because of its virgin gold and silver  and partly because he passed beneath it through the most horrible instant of his life .', 'turnbull was sitting on his seat on the lawn  and the golden evening impressed even his positive nature  as indeed it might have impressed the oxen in a field .', 'he was shocked out of his idle mood of awe by seeing macian break from behind the bushes and run across the lawn with an action he had never seen in the man before  with all his experience of the eccentric humours of this celt .', 'macian fell on the bench  shaking it so that it rattled  and gripped it with his knees like one in dreadful pain of body .', 'that particular run and tumble is typical only of a man who has been hit by some sudden and incurable evil  who is bitten by a viper or condemned to be hanged .', 'turnbull looked up in the white face of his friend and enemy  and almost turned cold at what he saw there .', 'he had seen the blue but gloomy eyes of the western highlander troubled by as many tempests as his own west highland seas  but there had always been a fixed star of faith behind the storms .', 'now the star had gone out  and there was only misery .', 'yet macian had the strength to answer the question where turnbull  taken by surprise  had not the strength to ask it .', ' they are right  they are right ', 'he cried .', ' o my god ', 'they are right  turnbull .', 'i ought to be here ', 'he went on with shapeless fluency as if he no longer had the heart to choose or check his speech .', ' i suppose i ought to have guessed long ago  all my big dreams and schemes  and everyone being against us  but i was stuck up  you know .', ' do tell me about it  really  cried the atheist  and  faced with the furnace of the other  s pain  he did not notice that he spoke with the affection of a father .', ' i am mad  turnbull  said evan  with a dead clearness of speech  and leant back against the garden seat .', ' nonsense  said the other  clutching at the obvious cue of benevolent brutality   this is one of your silly moods .', 'macian shook his head .', ' i know enough about myself  he said   to allow for any mood  though it opened heaven or hell .', 'but to see things  to see them walking solid in the sun  things that can  t be there  real mystics never do that  turnbull .', ' what things ', 'asked the other  incredulously .', 'macian lowered his voice .', ' i saw her  he said   three minutes ago  walking here in this hell yard .', 'between trying to look scornful and really looking startled  turnbull  s face was confused enough to emit no speech  and evan went on in monotonous sincerity ', ' i saw her walk behind those blessed trees against that holy sky of gold as plain as i can see her whenever i shut my eyes .', 'i did shut them  and opened them again  and she was still there  that is  of course  she wasn  t  she still had a little fur round her neck  but her dress was a shade brighter than when i really saw her .', ' my dear fellow  cried turnbull  rallying a hearty laugh   the fancies have really got hold of you .', 'you mistook some other poor girl here for her .', ' mistook some other  said macian  and words failed him altogether .', 'they sat for some moments in the mellow silence of the evening garden  a silence that was stifling for the sceptic  but utterly empty and final for the man of faith .', 'at last he broke out again with the words   well  anyhow  if i  m mad  i  m glad i  m mad on that .', 'turnbull murmured some clumsy deprecation  and sat stolidly smoking to collect his thoughts  the next instant he had all his nerves engaged in the mere effort to sit still .', 'across the clear space of cold silver and a pale lemon sky which was left by the gap in the ilex  trees there passed a slim  dark figure  a profile and the poise of a dark head like a bird  s  which really pinned him to his seat with the point of coincidence .', 'with an effort he got to his feet  and said with a voice of affected insouciance   by george ', 'macian  she is uncommonly like ', ' what ', 'cried macian  with a leap of eagerness that was heart  breaking   do you see her  too ', 'and the blaze came back into the centre of his eyes .', 'turnbull  s tawny eyebrows were pulled together with a peculiar frown of curiosity  and all at once he walked quickly across the lawn .', 'macian sat rigid  but peered after him with open and parched lips .', 'he saw the sight which either proved him sane or proved the whole universe half  witted  he saw the man of flesh approach that beautiful phantom  saw their gestures of recognition  and saw them against the sunset joining hands .', 'he could stand it no longer  but ran across to the path  turned the corner and saw standing quite palpable in the evening sunlight  talking with a casual grace to turnbull  the face and figure which had filled his midnights with frightfully vivid or desperately half  forgotten features .', 'she advanced quite pleasantly and coolly  and put out her hand .', 'the moment that he touched it he knew that he was sane even if the solar system was crazy .', 'she was entirely elegant and unembarrassed .', 'that is the awful thing about women  they refuse to be emotional at emotional moments  upon some such ludicrous pretext as there being someone else there .', 'but macian was in a condition of criticism much less than the average masculine one  being in fact merely overturned by the rushing riddle of the events .', 'evan does not know to this day what particular question he asked  but he vividly remembers that she answered  and every line or fluctuation of her face as she said it .', ' oh  don  t you know ', 'she said  smiling  and suddenly lifting her level brown eyebrows .', ' haven  t you heard the news ', 'i  m a lunatic .', 'then she added after a short pause  and with a sort of pride   i  ve got a certificate .', 'her manner  by the matchless social stoicism of her sex  was entirely suited to a drawing  room  but evan  s reply fell somewhat far short of such a standard  as he only said   what the devil in hell does all this nonsense mean ', ' really  said the young lady  and laughed .', ' i beg your pardon  said the unhappy young man  rather wildly   but what i mean is  why are you here in an asylum ', 'the young woman broke again into one of the maddening and mysterious laughs of femininity .', 'then she composed her features  and replied with equal dignity   well  if it comes to that  why are you ', 'the fact that turnbull had strolled away and was investigating rhododendrons may have been due to evan  s successful prayers to the other world  or possibly to his own pretty successful experience of this one .', 'but though they two were as isolated as a new adam and eve in a pretty ornamental eden  the lady did not relax by an inch the rigour of her badinage .', ' i am locked up in the madhouse  said evan  with a sort of stiff pride   because i tried to keep my promise to you .', ' quite so  answered the inexplicable lady  nodding with a perfectly blazing smile   and i am locked up because it was to me you promised .', ' it is outrageous ', 'cried evan   it is impossible ', ' oh  you can see my certificate if you like  she replied with some hauteur .', 'macian stared at her and then at his boots  and then at the sky and then at her again .', 'he was quite sure now that he himself was not mad  and the fact rather added to his perplexity .', 'then he drew nearer to her  and said in a dry and dreadful voice   oh  don  t condescend to play the fool with such a fool as me .', 'are you really locked up here as a patient  because you helped us to escape ', ' yes  she said  still smiling  but her steady voice had a shake in it .', 'evan flung his big elbow across his forehead and burst into tears .', 'the pure lemon of the sky faded into purer white as the great sunset silently collapsed .', 'the birds settled back into the trees  the moon began to glow with its own light .', 'mr . james turnbull continued his botanical researches into the structure of the rhododendron .', 'but the lady did not move an inch until evan had flung up his face again  and when he did he saw by the last gleam of sunlight that it was not only his face that was wet .', 'mr . james turnbull had all his life professed a profound interest in physical science  and the phenomena of a good garden were really a pleasure to him  but after three  quarters of an hour or so even the apostle of science began to find rhododendrus a bore  and was somewhat relieved when an unexpected development of events obliged him to transfer his researches to the equally interesting subject of hollyhocks  which grew some fifty feet farther along the path .', 'the ostensible cause of his removal was the unexpected reappearance of his two other acquaintances walking and talking laboriously along the way  with the black head bent close to the brown one .', 'even hollyhocks detained turnbull but a short time .', 'having rapidly absorbed all the important principles affecting the growth of those vegetables  he jumped over a flower  bed and walked back into the building .', 'the other two came up along the slow course of the path talking and talking .', 'no one but god knows what they said  for they certainly have forgotten  and if i remembered it i would not repeat it .', 'when they parted at the head of the walk she put out her hand again in the same well  bred way  although it trembled  he seemed to restrain a gesture as he let it fall .', ' if it is really always to be like this  he said  thickly   it would not matter if we were here for ever .', ' you tried to kill yourself four times for me  she said  unsteadily   and i have been chained up as a madwoman for you .', 'i really think that after that ', ' yes  i know  said evan in a low voice  looking down .', ' after that we belong to each other .', 'we are sort of sold to each other  until the stars fall .', 'then he looked up suddenly  and said   by the way  what is your name ', ' my name is beatrice drake  she replied with complete gravity .', ' you can see it on my certificate of lunacy .', 'xix .', 'the last parley', 'turnbull walked away  wildly trying to explain to himself the presence of two personal acquaintances so different as vane and the girl .', 'as he skirted a low hedge of laurel  an enormously tall young man leapt over it  stood in front of him  and almost fell on his neck as if seeking to embrace him .', ' don  t you know me ', 'almost sobbed the young man  who was in the highest spirits .', ' ain  t i written on your heart  old boy ', 'i say  what did you do with my yacht ', ' take your arms off my neck  said turnbull  irritably .', ' are you mad ', 'the young man sat down on the gravel path and went into ecstasies of laughter .', ' no  that  s just the fun of it  i  m not mad  he replied .', ' they  ve shut me up in this place  and i  m not mad .', 'and he went off again into mirth as innocent as wedding  bells .', 'turnbull  whose powers of surprise were exhausted  rolled his round grey eyes and said   mr . wilkinson  i think  because he could not think of anything else to say .', 'the tall man sitting on the gravel bowed with urbanity  and said   quite at your service .', 'not to be confused with the wilkinsons of cumberland  and as i say  old boy  what have you done with my yacht ', 'you see  they  ve locked me up here  in this garden  and a yacht would be a sort of occupation for an unmarried man .', ' i am really horribly sorry  began turnbull  in the last stage of bated bewilderment and exasperation   but really ', ' oh  i can see you can  t have it on you at the moment  said mr . wilkinson with much intellectual magnanimity .', ' well  the fact is  began turnbull again  and then the phrase was frozen on his mouth  for round the corner came the goatlike face and gleaming eye  glasses of dr . quayle .', ' ah  my dear mr . wilkinson  said the doctor  as if delighted at a coincidence   and mr . turnbull  too .', 'why  i want to speak to mr .', 'turnbull .', 'mr . turnbull made some movement rather of surrender than assent  and the doctor caught it up exquisitely  showing even more of his two front teeth .', ' i am sure mr . wilkinson will excuse us a moment .', 'and with flying frock  coat he led turnbull rapidly round the corner of a path .', ' my dear sir  he said  in a quite affectionate manner   i do not mind telling you  you are such a very hopeful case  you understand so well the scientific point of view  and i don  t like to see you bothered by the really hopeless cases .', 'they are monotonous and maddening .', 'the man you have just been talking to  poor fellow  is one of the strongest cases of pure idee fixe that we have .', 'it  s very sad  and i  m afraid utterly incurable .', 'he keeps on telling everybody  and the doctor lowered his voice confidentially  he tells everybody that two people have taken is yacht .', 'his account of how he lost it is quite incoherent .', 'turnbull stamped his foot on the gravel path  and called out   oh  i can  t stand this .', 'really ', ' i know  i know  said the psychologist  mournfully   it is a most melancholy case  and also fortunately a very rare one .', 'it is so rare  in fact  that in one classification of these maladies it is entered under a heading by itself  perdinavititis  mental inflammation creating the impression that one has lost a ship .', 'really  he added  with a kind of half  embarrassed guilt   it  s rather a feather in my cap .', 'i discovered the only existing case of perdinavititis .', ' but this won  t do  doctor  said turnbull  almost tearing his hair   this really won  t do .', 'the man really did lose a ship .', 'indeed  not to put too fine a point on it  i took his ship .', 'dr . quayle swung round for an instant so that his silk  lined overcoat rustled  and stared singularly at turnbull .', 'then he said with hurried amiability   why  of course you did .', 'quite so  quite so  and with courteous gestures went striding up the garden path .', 'under the first laburnum  tree he stopped  however  and pulling out his pencil and notebook wrote down feverishly   singular development in the elenthero  maniac  turnbull .', 'sudden manifestation of rapinavititis  the delusion that one has stolen a ship .', 'first case ever recorded .', 'turnbull stood for an instant staggered into stillness .', 'then he ran raging round the garden to find macian  just as a husband  even a bad husband  will run raging to find his wife if he is full of a furious query .', 'he found macian stalking moodily about the half  lit garden  after his extraordinary meeting with beatrice .', 'no one who saw his slouching stride and sunken head could have known that his soul was in the seventh heaven of ecstasy .', 'he did not think  he did not even very definitely desire .', 'he merely wallowed in memories  chiefly in material memories  words said with a certain cadence or trivial turns of the neck or wrist .', 'into the middle of his stationary and senseless enjoyment were thrust abruptly the projecting elbow and the projecting red beard of turnbull .', 'macian stepped back a little  and the soul in his eyes came very slowly to its windows .', 'when james turnbull had the glittering sword  point planted upon his breast he was in far less danger .', 'for three pulsating seconds after the interruption macian was in a mood to have murdered his father .', 'and yet his whole emotional anger fell from him when he saw turnbull  s face  in which the eyes seemed to be bursting from the head like bullets .', 'all the fire and fragrance even of young and honourable love faded for a moment before that stiff agony of interrogation .', ' are you hurt  turnbull ', 'he asked  anxiously .', ' i am dying  answered the other quite calmly .', ' i am in the quite literal sense of the words dying to know something .', 'i want to know what all this can possibly mean .', 'macian did not answer  and he continued with asperity   you are still thinking about that girl  but i tell you the whole

figure towered above turnbull with an arrogant stoop and a projecting chin  a chin of which the shape showed queerly even in its shadow upon the path .', ' you see that is not so easy  said macian between his teeth .', 'they looked up into the eyes of the master  but looked only for a moment .', 'the eyes were full of a frozen and icy wrath  a kind of utterly heartless hatred .', 'his voice was

long and satisfied sigh   then i was right .', 'and he turned his back and walked obediently towards the building .', 'turnbull seemed to canvass for a few minutes the notion of knocking the master down  and then fell under the same almost fairy fatalism as his companion .', 'in some strange way it did seem that the more smoothly they yielded  the more swiftly would events sweep on to some great collision .', 'xx .', 'dies irae', 'as they advanced towards the asylum they looked up at its rows on rows of windows  and understood the master  s material threat .', 'by means of that complex but concealed machinery which ran like a network of nerves over the whole fabric  there had been shot out under every window  ledge rows and rows of polished  steel cylinders  the cold miracles of modern gunnery .', 'they commanded the whole garden and the whole country  side  and could have blown to pieces an army corps .', 'this silent declaration of war had evidently had its complete effect .', 'as macian and turnbull walked steadily but slowly towards the entrance hall of the institution  they could see that most  or at least many  of the patients had already gathered there as well as the staff of doctors and the whole regiment of keepers and assistants .', 'but when they entered the lamp  lit hall  and the high iron door was clashed to and locked behind them  yet a new amazement leapt into their eyes  and the stalwart turnbull almost fell .', 'for he saw a sight which was indeed  as macian had said  either the day of judgement or a dream .', 'within a few feet of him at one corner of the square of standing people stood the girl he had known in jersey  madeleine durand .', 'she looked straight at him with a steady smile which lit up the scene of darkness and unreason like the light of some honest fireside .', 'her square face and throat were thrown back  as her habit was  and there was something almost sleepy in the geniality of her eyes .', 'he saw her first  and for a few seconds saw her only  then the outer edge of his eyesight took in all the other staring faces  and he saw all the faces he had ever seen for weeks and months past .', 'there was the tolstoyan in jaeger flannel  with the yellow beard that went backward and the foolish nose and eyes that went forward  with the curiosity of a crank .', 'he was talking eagerly to mr . gordon  the corpulent jew shopkeeper whom they had once gagged in his own shop .', 'there was the tipsy old hertfordshire rustic  he was talking energetically to himself .', 'there was not only mr . vane the magistrate  but the clerk of mr . vane  the magistrate .', 'there was not only miss drake of the motor  car  but also miss drake  s chauffeur .', 'nothing wild or unfamiliar could have produced upon turnbull such a nightmare impression as that ring of familiar faces .', 'yet he had one intellectual shock which was greater than all the others .', 'he stepped impulsively forward towards madeleine  and then wavered with a kind of wild humility .', 'as he did so he caught sight of another square face behind madeleine  s  a face with long grey whiskers and an austere stare .', 'it was old durand  the girls  father  and when turnbull saw him he saw the last and worst marvel of that monstrous night .', 'he remembered durand  he remembered his monotonous  everlasting lucidity  his stupefyingly sensible views of everything  his colossal contentment with truisms merely because they were true .', ' confound it all ', 'cried turnbull to himself   if he is in the asylum  there can  t be anyone outside .', 'he drew nearer to madeleine  but still doubtfully and all the more so because she still smiled at him .', 'macian had already gone across to beatrice with an air of fright .', 'then all these bewildered but partly amicable recognitions were cloven by a cruel voice which always made all human blood turn bitter .', 'the master was standing in the middle of the room surveying the scene like a great artist looking at a completed picture .', 'handsome as he looked  they had never seen so clearly what was really hateful in his face  and even then they could only express it by saying that the arched brows and the long emphatic chin gave it always a look of being lit from below  like the face of some infernal actor .', ' this is indeed a cosy party  he said  with glittering eyes .', 'the master evidently meant to say more  but before he could say anything m . durand had stepped right up to him and was speaking .', 'he was speaking exactly as a french bourgeois speaks to the manager of a restaurant .', 'that is  he spoke with rattling and breathless rapidity  but with no incoherence  and therefore with no emotion .', 'it was a steady  monotonous vivacity  which came not seemingly from passion  but merely from the reason having been sent off at a gallop .', 'he was saying something like this ', ' you refuse me my half  bottle of medoc  the drink the most wholesome and the most customary .', 'you refuse me the company and obedience of my daughter  which nature herself indicates .', 'you refuse me the beef and mutton  without pretence that it is a fast of the church .', 'you now forbid me the promenade  a thing necessary to a person of my age .', 'it is useless to tell me that you do all this by law .', 'law rests upon the social contract .', 'if the citizen finds himself despoiled of such pleasures and powers as he would have had even in the savage state  the social contract is annulled .', ' it  s no good chattering away  monsieur  said hutton  for the master was silent .', ' the place is covered with machine  guns .', 'we  ve got to obey our orders  and so have you .', ' the machinery is of the most perfect  assented durand  somewhat irrelevantly   worked by petroleum  i believe .', 'i only ask you to admit that if such things fall below the comfort of barbarism  the social contract is annulled .', 'it is a pretty little point of theory .', ' oh ', 'i dare say  said hutton .', 'durand bowed quite civilly and withdrew .', ' a cosy party  resumed the master  scornfully   and yet i believe some of you are in doubt about how we all came together .', 'i will explain it  ladies and gentlemen  i will explain everything .', 'to whom shall i specially address myself ', 'to mr . james turnbull .', 'he has a scientific mind .', 'turnbull seemed to choke with sudden protest .', 'the master seemed only to cough out of pure politeness and proceeded   mr . turnbull will agree with me  he said   when i say that we long felt in scientific circles that great harm was done by such a legend as that of the crucifixion .', 'turnbull growled something which was presumably assent .', 'the master went on smoothly   it was in vain for us to urge that the incident was irrelevant  that there were many such fanatics  many such executions .', 'we were forced to take the thing thoroughly in hand  to investigate it in the spirit of scientific history  and with the assistance of mr . turnbull and others we were happy in being able to announce that this alleged crucifixion never occurred at all .', 'macian lifted his head and looked at the master steadily  but turnbull did not look up .', ' this  we found  was the only way with all superstitions  continued the speaker   it was necessary to deny them historically  and we have done it with great success in the case of miracles and such things .', 'now within our own time there arose an unfortunate fuss which threatened  as mr . turnbull would say  to galvanize the corpse of christianity into a fictitious life  the alleged case of a highland eccentric who wanted to fight for the virgin .', 'macian  quite white  made a step forward  but the speaker did not alter his easy attitude or his flow of words .', ' again we urged that this duel was not to be admired  that it was a mere brawl  but the people were ignorant and romantic .', 'there were signs of treating this alleged highlander and his alleged opponent as heroes .', 'we tried all other means of arresting this reactionary hero worship .', 'working men who betted on the duel were imprisoned for gambling .', 'working men who drank the health of a duellist were imprisoned for drunkenness .', 'but the popular excitement about the alleged duel continued  and we had to fall back on our old historical method .', 'we investigated  on scientific principles  the story of macian  s challenge  and we are happy to be able to inform you that the whole story of the attempted duel is a fable .', 'there never was any challenge .', 'there never was any man named macian .', 'it is a melodramatic myth  like calvary .', 'not a soul moved save turnbull  who lifted his head  yet there was the sense of a silent explosion .', ' the whole story of the macian challenge  went on the master  beaming at them all with a sinister benignity   has been found to originate in the obsessions of a few pathological types  who are now all fortunately in our care .', 'there is  for instance  a person here of the name of gordon  formerly the keeper of a curiosity shop .', 'he is a victim of the disease called vinculomania  the impression that one has been bound or tied up .', 'we have also a case of fugacity  mr . whimpey  who imagines that he was chased by two men .', 'the indignant faces of the jew shopkeeper and the magdalen don started out of the crowd in their indignation  but the speaker continued ', ' one poor woman we have with us  he said  in a compassionate voice   believes she was in a motor  car with two such men  this is the well  known illusion of speed on which i need not dwell .', 'another wretched woman has the simple egotistic mania that she has caused the duel .', 'madeleine durand actually professes to have been the subject of the fight between macian and his enemy  a fight which  if it occurred at all  certainly began long before .', 'but it never occurred at all .', 'we have taken in hand every person who professed to have seen such a thing  and proved them all to be unbalanced .', 'that is why they are here .', 'the master looked round the room  just showing his perfect teeth with the perfection of artistic cruelty  exalted for a moment in the enormous simplicity of his success  and then walked across the hall and vanished through an inner door .', 'his two lieutenants  quayle and hutton  were left standing at the head of the great army of servants and keepers .', ' i hope we shall have no more trouble  said dr . quayle pleasantly enough  and addressing turnbull  who was leaning heavily upon the back of a chair .', 'still looking down  turnbull lifted the chair an inch or two from the ground .', 'then he suddenly swung it above his head and sent it at the inquiring doctor with an awful crash which sent one of its wooden legs loose along the floor and crammed the doctor gasping into a corner .', 'macian gave a great shout  snatched up the loose chair  leg  and  rushing on the other doctor  felled him with a blow .', 'twenty attendants rushed to capture the rebels  macian flung back three of them and turnbull went over on top of one  when from behind them all came a shriek as of something quite fresh and frightful .', 'two of the three passages leading out of the hall were choked with blue smoke .', 'another instant and the hall was full of the fog of it  and red sparks began to swarm like scarlet bees .', ' the place is on fire ', 'cried quayle with a scream of indecent terror .', ' oh  who can have done it ', 'how can it have happened ', 'a light had come into turnbull  s eyes .', ' how did the french revolution happen ', 'he asked .', ' oh  how should i know ', 'wailed the other .', ' then i will tell you  said turnbull   it happened because some people fancied that a french grocer was as respectable as he looked .', 'even as he spoke  as if by confirmation  old mr . durand re  entered the smoky room quite placidly  wiping the petroleum from his hands with a handkerchief .', 'he had set fire to the building in accordance with the strict principles of the social contract .', 'but macian had taken a stride forward and stood there shaken and terrible .', ' now  he cried  panting   now is the judgement of the world .', 'the doctors will leave this place  the keepers will leave this place .', 'they will leave us in charge of the machinery and the machine  guns at the windows .', 'but we  the lunatics  will wait to be burned alive if only we may see them go .', ' how do you know we shall go ', 'asked hutton  fiercely .', ' you believe nothing  said macian  simply   and you are insupportably afraid of death .', ' so this is suicide  sneered the doctor   a somewhat doubtful sign of sanity .', ' not at all  this is vengeance  answered turnbull  quite calmly   a thing which is completely healthy .', ' you think the doctors will go  said hutton  savagely .', ' the keepers have gone already  said turnbull .', 'even as they spoke the main doors were burst open in mere brutal panic  and all the officers and subordinates of the asylum rushed away across the garden pursued by the smoke .', 'but among the ticketed maniacs not a man or woman moved .', ' we hate dying  said turnbull  with composure   but we hate you even more .', 'this is a successful revolution .', 'in the roof above their heads a panel shot back  showing a strip of star  lit sky and a huge thing made of white metal  with the shape and fins of a fish  swinging as if at anchor .', 'at the same moment a steel ladder slid down from the opening and struck the floor  and the cleft chin of the mysterious master was thrust into the opening .', ' quayle  hutton  he said   you will escape with me .', 'and they went up the ladder like automata of lead .', 'long after they had clambered into the car  the creature with the cloven face continued to leer down upon the smoke  stung crowd below .', 'then at last he said in a silken voice and with a smile of final satisfaction ', ' by the way  i fear i am very absent minded .', 'there is one man specially whom  somehow  i always forget .', 'i always leave him lying about .', 'once i mislaid him on the cross of st . paul  s .', 'so silly of me  and now i  ve forgotten him in one of those little cells where your fire is burning .', 'very unfortunate  especially for him .', 'and nodding genially  he climbed into his flying ship .', 'macian stood motionless for two minutes  and then rushed down one of the suffocating corridors till he found the flames .', 'turnbull looked once at madeleine  and followed .', '  ', 'macian  with singed hair  smoking garments  and smarting hands and face  had already broken far enough through the first barriers of burning timber to come within cry of the cells he had once known .', 'it was impossible  however  to see the spot where the old man lay dead or alive  not now through darkness  but through scorching and aching light .', 'the site of the old half  wit  s cell was now the heart of a standing forest of fire  the flames as thick and yellow as a cornfield .', 'their incessant shrieking and crackling was like a mob shouting against an orator .', 'yet through all that deafening density macian thought he heard a small and separate sound .', 'when he heard it he rushed forward as if to plunge into that furnace  but turnbull arrested him by an elbow .', ' let me go ', 'cried evan  in agony   it  s the poor old beggar  s voice  he  s still alive  and shouting for help .', ' listen ', 'said turnbull  and lifted one finger from his clenched hand .', ' or else he is shrieking with pain  protested macian .', ' i will not endure it .', ' listen ', 'repeated turnbull  grimly .', ' did you ever hear anyone shout for help or shriek with pain in that voice ', 'the small shrill sounds which came through the crash of the conflagration were indeed of an odd sort  and macian turned a face of puzzled inquiry to his companion .', ' he is singing  said turnbull  simply .', 'a remaining rampart fell  crushing the fire  and through the diminished din of it the voice of the little old lunatic came clearer .', 'in the heart of that white  hot hell he was singing like a bird .', 'what he was singing it was not very easy to follow  but it seemed to be something about playing in the golden hay .', ' good lord ', 'cried turnbull  bitterly   there seem to be some advantages in really being an idiot .', 'then advancing to the fringe of the fire he called out on chance to the invisible singer   can you come out ', 'are you cut off ', ' god help us all ', 'said macian  with a shudder   he  s laughing now .', 'at whatever stage of being burned alive the invisible now found himself  he was now shaking out peals of silvery and hilarious laughter .', 'as he listened  macian  s two eyes began to glow  as if a strange thought had come into his head .', ' fool  come out and save yourself ', 'shouted turnbull .', ' no  by heaven ', 'that is not the way  cried evan  suddenly .', ' father  he shouted   come out and save us all ', 'the fire  though it had dropped in one or two places  was  upon the whole  higher and more unconquerable than ever .', 'separate tall flames shot up and spread out above them like the fiery cloisters of some infernal cathedral  or like a grove of red tropical trees in the garden of the devil .', 'higher yet in the purple hollow of the night the topmost flames leapt again and again fruitlessly at the stars  like golden dragons chained but struggling .', 'the towers and domes of the oppressive smoke seemed high and far enough to drown distant planets in a london fog .', 'but if we exhausted all frantic similes for that frantic scene  the main impression about the fire would still be its ranked upstanding rigidity and a sort of roaring stillness .', 'it was literally a wall of fire .', ' father  cried macian  once more   come out of it and save us all ', 'turnbull was staring at him as he cried .', 'the tall and steady forest of fire must have been already a portent visible to the whole circle of land and sea .', 'the red flush of it lit up the long sides of white ships far out in the german ocean  and picked out like piercing rubies the windows in the villages on the distant heights .', 'if any villagers or sailors were looking towards it they must have seen a strange sight as macian cried out for the third time .', 'that forest of fire wavered  and was cloven in the centre  and then the whole of one half of it leaned one way as a cornfield leans all one way under the load of the wind .', 'indeed  it looked as if a great wind had sprung up and driven the great fire aslant .', 'its smoke was no longer sent up to choke the stars  but was trailed and dragged across county after county like one dreadful banner of defeat .', 'but it was not the wind  or  if it was the wind  it was two winds blowing in opposite directions .', 'for while one half of the huge fire sloped one way towards the inland heights  the other half  at exactly the same angle  sloped out eastward towards the sea .', 'so that earth and ocean could behold  where there had been a mere fiery mass  a thing divided like a v  a cloven tongue of flame .', 'but if it were a prodigy for those distant  it was something beyond speech for those quite near .', 'as the echoes of evan  s last appeal rang and died in the universal uproar  the fiery vault over his head opened down the middle  and  reeling back in two great golden billows  hung on each side as huge and harmless as two sloping hills lie on each side of a valley .', 'down the centre of this trough  or chasm  a little path ran  cleared of all but ashes  and down this little path was walking a little old man singing as if he were alone in a wood in spring .', 'when james turnbull saw this he suddenly put out a hand and seemed to support himself on the strong shoulder of madeleine durand .', 'then after a moment  s hesitation he put his other hand on the shoulder of macian .', 'his blue eyes looked extraordinarily brilliant and beautiful .', 'in many sceptical papers and magazines afterwards he was sadly or sternly rebuked for having abandoned the certainties of materialism .', 'all his life up to that moment he had been most honestly certain that materialism was a fact .', 'but he was unlike the writers in the magazines precisely in this  that he preferred a fact even to materialism .', 'as the little singing figure came nearer and nearer  evan fell on his knees  and after an instant beatrice followed  then madeleine fell on her knees  and after a longer instant turnbull followed .', 'then the little old man went past them singing down that corridor of flames .', 'they had not looked at his face .', 'when he had passed they looked up .', 'while the first light of the fire had shot east and west  painting the sides of ships with fire  light or striking red sparks out of windowed houses  it had not hitherto struck upward  for there was above it the ponderous and rococo cavern of its own monstrous coloured smoke .', 'but now the fire was turned to left and right like a woman  s hair parted in the middle  and now the shafts of its light could shoot up into empty heavens and strike anything  either bird or cloud .', 'but it struck something that was neither cloud nor bird .', 'far  far away up in those huge hollows of space something was flying swiftly and shining brightly  something that shone too bright and flew too fast to be any of the fowls of the air  though the red light lit it from underneath like the breast of a bird .', 'everyone knew it was a flying ship  and everyone knew whose .', 'as they stared upward the little speck of light seemed slightly tilted  and two black dots dropped from the edge of it .', 'all the eager  upturned faces watched the two dots as they grew bigger and bigger in their downward rush .', 'then someone screamed  and no one looked up any more .', 'for the two bodies  larger every second flying  spread out and sprawling in the fire  light  were the dead bodies of the two doctors whom professor lucifer had carried with him  the weak and sneering quayle  the cold and clumsy hutton .', 'they went with a crash into the thick of the fire .', ' they are gone ', 'screamed beatrice  hiding her head .', ' o god ', 'the are lost ', 'evan put his arm about her  and remembered his own vision .', ' no  they are not lost  he said .', ' they are saved .', 'he has taken away no souls with him  after all .', 'he looked vaguely about at

baronetage  there he found occupation for an idle hour  and consolation in a distressed one  there his faculties were roused into admiration and respect  by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents  there any unwelcome sensations  arising from domestic affairs changed naturally into pity and contempt as he turned over the almost endless creations of the last century  and there  if every other leaf were powerless  he could read his own history with an interest which never failed .', 'this was the page at which the favourite volume always opened ', ' elliot of kellynch hall

the county of somerset  and by inserting most accurately the day of the month on which he had lost his wife .', 'then followed the history and rise of the ancient and respectable family  in the usual

fine man .', 'few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did  nor could the valet of any new made lord be more delighted with the place he held in society .', 'he considered the blessing of beauty as inferior only to the blessing of a baronetcy  and the sir walter elliot  who united these gifts  was the constant object of his warmest respect and devotion .', 'his good looks and his rank had one fair claim on his attachment  since to them he must have owed a wife of very superior character to any thing deserved by his own .', 'lady elliot had been an excellent woman  sensible and amiable  whose judgement and conduct  if they might be pardoned the youthful infatuation which made her lady elliot  had never required indulgence afterwards . she had humoured  or softened  or concealed his failings  and promoted his real respectability for seventeen years  and though not the very happiest being in the world herself  had found enough in her duties  her friends  and her children  to attach her to life  and make it no matter of indifference to her when she was called on to quit them .', ' three girls  the two eldest sixteen and fourteen  was an awful legacy for a mother to bequeath  an awful charge rather  to confide to the authority and guidance of a conceited  silly father .', 'she had  however  one very intimate friend  a sensible  deserving woman  who had been brought  by strong attachment to herself  to settle close by her  in the village of kellynch  and on her kindness and advice  lady elliot mainly relied for the best help and maintenance of the good principles and instruction which she had been anxiously giving her daughters .', 'this friend  and sir walter  did not marry  whatever might have been anticipated on that head by their acquaintance .', 'thirteen years had passed away since lady elliot  s death  and they were still near neighbours and intimate friends  and one remained a widower  the other a widow .', 'that lady russell  of steady age and character  and extremely well provided for  should have no thought of a second marriage  needs no apology to the public  which is rather apt to be unreasonably discontented when a woman does marry again  than when she does not  but sir walter  s continuing in singleness requires explanation .', 'be it known then  that sir walter  like a good father   having met with one or two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications  prided himself on remaining single for his dear daughters  sake .', 'for one daughter  his eldest  he would really have given up any thing  which he had not been very much tempted to do .', 'elizabeth had succeeded  at sixteen  to all that was possible  of her mother  s rights and consequence  and being very handsome  and very like himself  her influence had always been great  and they had gone on together most happily .', 'his two other children were of very inferior value .', 'mary had acquired a little artificial importance  by becoming mrs charles musgrove  but anne  with an elegance of mind and sweetness of character  which must have placed her high with any people of real understanding  was nobody with either father or sister  her word had no weight  her convenience was always to give way  she was only anne .', 'to lady russell  indeed  she was a most dear and highly valued god  daughter  favourite  and friend .', 'lady russell loved them all  but it was only in anne that she could fancy the mother to revive again .', 'a few years before  anne elliot had been a very pretty girl  but her bloom had vanished early  and as even in its height  her father had found little to admire in her   so totally different were her delicate features and mild dark eyes from his own  there could be nothing in them  now that she was faded and thin  to excite his esteem .', 'he had never indulged much hope  he had now none  of ever reading her name in any other page of his favourite work .', 'all equality of alliance must rest with elizabeth  for mary had merely connected herself with an old country family of respectability and large fortune  and had therefore given all the honour and received none  elizabeth would  one day or other  marry suitably .', 'it sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty  nine than she was ten years before  and  generally speaking  if there has been neither ill health nor anxiety  it is a time of life at which scarcely any charm is lost .', 'it was so with elizabeth  still the same handsome miss elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago  and sir walter might be excused  therefore  in forgetting her age  or  at least  be deemed only half a fool  for thinking himself and elizabeth as blooming as ever  amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody else  for he could plainly see how old all the rest of his family and acquaintance were growing .', 'anne haggard  mary coarse  every face in the neighbourhood worsting  and the rapid increase of the crow  s foot about lady russell  s temples had long been a distress to him .', 'elizabeth did not quite equal her father in personal contentment .', 'thirteen years had seen her mistress of kellynch hall  presiding and directing with a self  possession and decision which could never have given the idea of her being younger than she was .', 'for thirteen years had she been doing the honours  and laying down the domestic law at home  and leading the way to the chaise and four  and walking immediately after lady russell out of all the drawing  rooms and dining  rooms in the country .', 'thirteen winters  revolving frosts had seen her opening every ball of credit which a scanty neighbourhood afforded  and thirteen springs shewn their blossoms  as she travelled up to london with her father  for a few weeks  annual enjoyment of the great world .', 'she had the remembrance of all this  she had the consciousness of being nine  and  twenty to give her some regrets and some apprehensions  she was fully satisfied of being still quite as handsome as ever  but she felt her approach to the years of danger  and would have rejoiced to be certain of being properly solicited by baronet  blood within the next twelvemonth or two .', 'then might she again take up the book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youth  but now she liked it not .', 'always to be presented with the date of her own birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister  made the book an evil  and more than once  when her father had left it open on the table near her  had she closed it  with averted eyes  and pushed it away .', 'she had had a disappointment  moreover  which that book  and especially the history of her own family  must ever present the remembrance of .', 'the heir presumptive  the very william walter elliot  esq . whose rights had been so generously supported by her father  had disappointed her .', 'she had  while a very young girl  as soon as she had known him to be  in the event of her having no brother  the future baronet  meant to marry him  and her father had always meant that she should .', 'he had not been known to them as a boy  but soon after lady elliot  s death  sir walter had sought the acquaintance  and though his overtures had not been met with any warmth  he had persevered in seeking it  making allowance for the modest drawing  back of youth  and  in one of their spring excursions to london  when elizabeth was in her first bloom  mr elliot had been forced into the introduction .', 'he was at that time a very young man  just engaged in the study of the law  and elizabeth found him extremely agreeable  and every plan in his favour was confirmed .', 'he was invited to kellynch hall  he was talked of and expected all the rest of the year  but he never came .', 'the following spring he was seen again in town  found equally agreeable  again encouraged  invited  and expected  and again he did not come  and the next tidings were that he was married .', 'instead of pushing his fortune in the line marked out for the heir of the house of elliot  he had purchased independence by uniting himself to a rich woman of inferior birth .', 'sir walter has resented it .', 'as the head of the house  he felt that he ought to have been consulted  especially after taking the young man so publicly by the hand   for they must have been seen together  he observed   once at tattersall  s  and twice in the lobby of the house of commons .', 'his disapprobation was expressed  but apparently very little regarded .', 'mr elliot had attempted no apology  and shewn himself as unsolicitous of being longer noticed by the family  as sir walter considered him unworthy of it  all acquaintance between them had ceased .', 'this very awkward history of mr elliot was still  after an interval of several years  felt with anger by elizabeth  who had liked the man for himself  and still more for being her father  s heir  and whose strong family pride could see only in him a proper match for sir walter elliot  s eldest daughter .', 'there was not a baronet from a to z whom her feelings could have so willingly acknowledged as an equal .', 'yet so miserably had he conducted himself  that though she was at this present time  the summer of   wearing black ribbons for his wife  she could not admit him to be worth thinking of again .', 'the disgrace of his first marriage might  perhaps  as there was no reason to suppose it perpetuated by offspring  have been got over  had he not done worse  but he had  as by the accustomary intervention of kind friends  they had been informed  spoken most disrespectfully of them all  most slightingly and contemptuously of the very blood he belonged to  and the honours which were hereafter to be his own .', 'this could not be pardoned .', 'such were elizabeth elliot  s sentiments and sensations  such the cares to alloy  the agitations to vary  the sameness and the elegance  the prosperity and the nothingness of her scene of life  such the feelings to give interest to a long  uneventful residence in one country circle  to fill the vacancies which there were no habits of utility abroad  no talents or accomplishments for home  to occupy .', 'but now  another occupation and solicitude of mind was beginning to be added to these .', 'her father was growing distressed for money .', 'she knew  that when he now took up the baronetage  it was to drive the heavy bills of his tradespeople  and the unwelcome hints of mr shepherd  his agent  from his thoughts .', 'the kellynch property was good  but not equal to sir walter  s apprehension of the state required in its possessor .', 'while lady elliot lived  there had been method  moderation  and economy  which had just kept him within his income  but with her had died all such right  mindedness  and from that period he had been constantly exceeding it .', 'it had not been possible for him to spend less  he had done nothing but what sir walter elliot was imperiously called on to do  but blameless as he was  he was not only growing dreadfully in debt  but was hearing of it so often  that it became vain to attempt concealing it longer  even partially  from his daughter .', 'he had given her some hints of it the last spring in town  he had gone so far even as to say   can we retrench ', 'does it occur to you that there is any one article in which we can retrench ', 'and elizabeth  to do her justice  had  in the first ardour of female alarm  set seriously to think what could be done  and had finally proposed these two branches of economy  to cut off some unnecessary charities  and to refrain from new furnishing the drawing  room  to which expedients she afterwards added the happy thought of their taking no present down to anne  as had been the usual yearly custom .', 'but these measures  however good in themselves  were insufficient for the real extent of the evil  the whole of which sir walter found himself obliged to confess to her soon afterwards .', 'elizabeth had nothing to propose of deeper efficacy .', 'she felt herself ill  used and unfortunate  as did her father  and they were neither of them able to devise any means of lessening their expenses without compromising their dignity  or relinquishing their comforts in a way not to be borne .', 'there was only a small part of his estate that sir walter could dispose of  but had every acre been alienable  it would have made no difference .', 'he had condescended to mortgage as far as he had the power  but he would never condescend to sell .', 'no  he would never disgrace his name so far .', 'the kellynch estate should be transmitted whole and entire  as he had received it .', 'their two confidential friends  mr shepherd  who lived in the neighbouring market town  and lady russell  were called to advise them  and both father and daughter seemed to expect that something should be struck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassments and reduce their expenditure  without involving the loss of any indulgence of taste or pride .', 'chapter ', 'mr shepherd  a civil  cautious lawyer  who  whatever might be his hold or his views on sir walter  would rather have the disagreeable prompted by anybody else  excused himself from offering the slightest hint  and only begged leave to recommend an implicit reference to the excellent judgement of lady russell  from whose known good sense he fully expected to have just such resolute measures advised as he meant to see finally adopted .', 'lady russell was most anxiously zealous on the subject  and gave it much serious consideration .', 'she was a woman rather of sound than of quick abilities  whose difficulties in coming to any decision in this instance were great  from the opposition of two leading principles .', 'she was of strict integrity herself  with a delicate sense of honour  but she was as desirous of saving sir walter  s feelings  as solicitous for the credit of the family  as aristocratic in her ideas of what was due to them  as anybody of sense and honesty could well be .', 'she was a benevolent  charitable  good woman  and capable of strong attachments  most correct in her conduct  strict in her notions of decorum  and with manners that were held a standard of good  breeding .', 'she had a cultivated mind  and was  generally speaking  rational and consistent  but she had prejudices on the side of ancestry  she had a value for rank and consequence  which blinded her a little to the faults of those who possessed them .', 'herself the widow of only a knight  she gave the dignity of a baronet all its due  and sir walter  independent of his claims as an old acquaintance  an attentive neighbour  an obliging landlord  the husband of her very dear friend  the father of anne and her sisters  was  as being sir walter  in her apprehension  entitled to a great deal of compassion and consideration under his present difficulties .', 'they must retrench  that did not admit of a doubt .', 'but she was very anxious to have it done with the least possible pain to him and elizabeth .', 'she drew up plans of economy  she made exact calculations  and she did what nobody else thought of doing  she consulted anne  who never seemed considered by the others as having any interest in the question .', 'she consulted  and in a degree was influenced by her in marking out the scheme of retrenchment which was at last submitted to sir walter .', 'every emendation of anne  s had been on the side of honesty against importance .', 'she wanted more vigorous measures  a more complete reformation  a quicker release from debt  a much higher tone of indifference for everything but justice and equity .', ' if we can persuade your father to all this  said lady russell  looking over her paper   much may be done .', 'if he will adopt these regulations  in seven years he will be clear  and i hope we may be able to convince him and elizabeth  that kellynch hall has a respectability in itself which cannot be affected by these reductions  and that the true dignity of sir walter elliot will be very far from lessened in the eyes of sensible people  by acting like a man of principle .', 'what will he be doing  in fact  but what very many of our first families have done  or ought to do ', 'there will be nothing singular in his case  and it is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering  as it always does of our conduct .', 'i have great hope of prevailing .', 'we must be serious and decided  for after all  the person who has contracted debts must pay them  and though a great deal is due to the feelings of the gentleman  and the head of a house  like your father  there is still more due to the character of an honest man .', 'this was the principle on which anne wanted her father to be proceeding  his friends to be urging him .', 'she considered it as an act of indispensable duty to clear away the claims of creditors with all the expedition which the most comprehensive retrenchments could secure  and saw no dignity in anything short of it .', 'she wanted it to be prescribed  and felt as a duty .', 'she rated lady russell  s influence highly  and as to the severe degree of self  denial which her own conscience prompted  she believed there might be little more difficulty in persuading them to a complete  than to half a reformation .', 'her knowledge of her father and elizabeth inclined her to think that the sacrifice of one pair of horses would be hardly less painful than of both  and so on  through the whole list of lady russell  s too gentle reductions .', 'how anne  s more rigid requisitions might have been taken is of little consequence .', 'lady russell  s had no success at all  could not be put up with  were not to be borne .', ' what ', 'every comfort of life knocked off ', 'journeys  london  servants  horses  table  contractions and restrictions every where ', 'to live no longer with the decencies even of a private gentleman ', 'no  he would sooner quit kellynch hall at once  than remain in it on such disgraceful terms .', ' quit kellynch hall .', 'the hint was immediately taken up by mr shepherd  whose interest was involved in the reality of sir walter  s retrenching  and who was perfectly persuaded that nothing would be done without a change of abode .', ' since the idea had been started in the very quarter which ought to dictate  he had no scruple  he said   in confessing his judgement to be entirely on that side .', 'it did not appear to him that sir walter could materially alter his style of living in a house which had such a character of hospitality and ancient dignity to support .', 'in any other place sir walter might judge for himself  and would be looked up to  as regulating the modes of life in whatever way he might choose to model his household .', 'sir walter would quit kellynch hall  and after a very few days more of doubt and indecision  the great question of whither he should go was settled  and the first outline of this important change made out .', 'there had been three alternatives  london  bath  or another house in the country .', 'all anne  s wishes had been for the latter .', 'a small house in their own neighbourhood  where they might still have lady russell  s society  still be near mary  and still have the pleasure of sometimes seeing the lawns and groves of kellynch  was the object of her ambition .', 'but the usual fate of anne attended her  in having something very opposite from her inclination fixed on .', 'she disliked bath  and did not think it agreed with her  and bath was to be her home .', 'sir walter had at first thought more of london  but mr shepherd felt that he could not be trusted in london  and had been skilful enough to dissuade him from it  and make bath preferred .', 'it was a much safer place for a gentleman in his predicament  he might there be important at comparatively little expense .', 'two material advantages of bath over london had of course been given all their weight  its more convenient distance from kellynch  only fifty miles  and lady russell  s spending some part of every winter there  and to the very great satisfaction of lady russell  whose first views on the projected change had been for bath  sir walter and elizabeth were induced to believe that they should lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there .', 'lady russell felt obliged to oppose her dear anne  s known wishes .', 'it would be too much to expect sir walter to descend into a small house in his own neighbourhood .', 'anne herself would have found the mortifications of it more than she foresaw  and to sir walter  s feelings they must have been dreadful .', 'and with regard to anne  s dislike of bath  she considered it as a prejudice and mistake arising  first  from the circumstance of her having been three years at school there  after her mother  s death  and secondly  from her happening to be not in perfectly good spirits the only winter which she had afterwards spent there with herself .', 'lady russell was fond of bath  in short  and disposed to think it must suit them all  and as to her young friend  s health  by passing all the warm months with her at kellynch lodge  every danger would be avoided  and it was in fact  a change which must do both health and spirits good .', 'anne had been too little from home  too little seen .', 'her spirits were not high .', 'a larger society would improve them .', 'she wanted her to be more known .', 'the undesirableness of any other house in the same neighbourhood for sir walter was certainly much strengthened by one part  and a very material part of the scheme  which had been happily engrafted on the beginning .', 'he was not only to quit his home  but to see it in the hands of others  a trial of fortitude  which stronger heads than sir walter  s have found too much .', 'kellynch hall was to be

shepherd had once mentioned the word  advertise  but never dared approach it again .', 'sir walter spurned the idea of its being offered in any manner  forbad the slightest hint being dropped of his having such an intention  and it was only on the supposition of his being spontaneously solicited by some most unexceptionable applicant  on his own terms  and as a great favour  that he would let it at all .', 'how quick come the reasons for approving what we like ', 'lady russell had another excellent one at hand  for being extremely glad that sir walter and his family were to remove from the country .', 'elizabeth had been lately forming an intimacy  which she wished to see interrupted .', 'it was with the daughter of mr shepherd  who had returned  after an unprosperous marriage  to her father  s house  with the additional burden of two children .', 'she was a clever young woman  who understood the art of pleasing  the art of pleasing  at least  at kellynch hall  and who had made herself so acceptable to miss elliot  as to have been already staying there more than once  in spite of all that lady russell  who thought it a friendship quite out of place  could hint of caution and reserve .', 'lady russell  indeed  had scarcely any influence with elizabeth  and seemed to love her  rather because she would love her  than because elizabeth deserved it .', 'she had never received from her more than outward attention  nothing beyond the observances of complaisance  had never succeeded in any point which she wanted to carry  against previous inclination .', 'she had been repeatedly very earnest in trying to get anne included in the visit to london  sensibly open to all the injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements which shut her out  and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured to give elizabeth the advantage of her own better judgement and experience  but always in vain  elizabeth would go her own way  and never had she pursued it in more decided opposition to lady russell than in this selection of mrs clay  turning from the society of so deserving a sister  to bestow her affection and confidence on one who ought to have been nothing to her but the object of distant civility .', 'from situation  mrs clay was  in lady russell  s estimate  a very unequal  and in her character she believed a very dangerous companion  and a removal that would leave mrs clay behind  and bring a choice of more suitable intimates within miss elliot  s reach  was therefore an object of first  rate importance .', 'chapter ', ' i must take leave to observe  sir walter  said mr shepherd one morning at kellynch hall  as he laid down the newspaper   that the present juncture is much in our favour .', 'this peace will be turning all our rich naval officers ashore .', 'they will be all wanting a home .', 'could not be a better time  sir walter  for having a choice of tenants  very responsible tenants .', 'many a noble fortune has been made during the war .', 'if a rich admiral were to come in our way  sir walter ', ' he would be a very lucky man  shepherd  replied sir walter   that  s all i have to remark .', 'a prize indeed would kellynch hall be to him  rather the greatest prize of all  let him have taken ever so many before  hey  shepherd ', 'mr shepherd laughed  as he knew he must  at this wit  and then added ', ' i presume to observe  sir walter  that  in the way of business  gentlemen of the navy are well to deal with .', 'i have had a little knowledge of their methods of doing business  and i am free to confess that they have very liberal notions  and are as likely to make desirable tenants as any set of people one should meet with .', 'therefore  sir walter  what i would take leave to suggest is  that if in consequence of any rumours getting abroad of your intention  which must be contemplated as a possible thing  because we know how difficult it is to keep the actions and designs of one part of the world from the notice and curiosity of the other  consequence has its tax  i  john shepherd  might conceal any family  matters that i chose  for nobody would think it worth their while to observe me  but sir walter elliot has eyes upon him which it may be very difficult to elude  and therefore  thus much i venture upon  that it will not greatly surprise me if  with all our caution  some rumour of the truth should get abroad  in the supposition of which  as i was going to observe  since applications will unquestionably follow  i should think any from our wealthy naval commanders particularly worth attending to  and beg leave to add  that two hours will bring me over at any time  to save you the trouble of replying .', 'sir walter only nodded .', 'but soon afterwards  rising and pacing the room  he observed sarcastically ', ' there are few among the gentlemen of the navy  i imagine  who would not be surprised to find themselves in a house of this description .', ' they would look around them  no doubt  and bless their good fortune  said mrs clay  for mrs clay was present  her father had driven her over  nothing being of so much use to mrs clay  s health as a drive to kellynch   but i quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be a very desirable tenant .', 'i have known a good deal of the profession  and besides their liberality  they are so neat and careful in all their ways ', 'these valuable pictures of yours  sir walter  if you chose to leave them  would be perfectly safe .', 'everything in and about the house would be taken such excellent care of ', 'the gardens and shrubberies would be kept in almost as high order as they are now .', 'you need not be afraid  miss elliot  of your own sweet flower gardens being neglected .', ' as to all that  rejoined sir walter coolly   supposing i were induced to let my house  i have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges to be annexed to it .', 'i am not particularly disposed to favour a tenant .', 'the park would be open to him of course  and few navy officers  or men of any other description  can have had such a range  but what restrictions i might impose on the use of the pleasure  grounds  is another thing .', 'i am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies being always approachable  and i should recommend miss elliot to be on her guard with respect to her flower garden .', 'i am very little disposed to grant a tenant of kellynch hall any extraordinary favour  i assure you  be he sailor or soldier .', 'after a short pause  mr shepherd presumed to say ', ' in all these cases  there are established usages which make everything plain and easy between landlord and tenant .', 'your interest  sir walter  is in pretty safe hands .', 'depend upon me for taking care that no tenant has more than his just rights .', 'i venture to hint  that sir walter elliot cannot be half so jealous for his own  as john shepherd will be for him .', 'here anne spoke ', ' the navy  i think  who have done so much for us  have at least an equal claim with any other set of men  for all the comforts and all the privileges which any home can give .', 'sailors work hard enough for their comforts  we must all allow .', ' very true  very true .', 'what miss anne says  is very true  was mr shepherd  s rejoinder  and  oh ', 'certainly  was his daughter  s  but sir walter  s remark was  soon afterwards ', ' the profession has its utility  but i should be sorry to see any friend of mine belonging to it .', ' indeed ', 'was the reply  and with a look of surprise .', ' yes  it is in two points offensive to me  i have two strong grounds of objection to it .', 'first  as being the means of bringing persons of obscure birth into undue distinction  and raising men to honours which their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of  and secondly  as it cuts up a man  s youth and vigour most horribly  a sailor grows old sooner than any other man .', 'i have observed it all my life .', 'a man is in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise of one whose father  his father might have disdained to speak to  and of becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself  than in any other line .', 'one day last spring  in town  i was in company with two men  striking instances of what i am talking of  lord st ives  whose father we all know to have been a country curate  without bread to eat  i was to give place to lord st ives  and a certain admiral baldwin  the most deplorable  looking personage you can imagine  his face the colour of mahogany  rough and rugged to the last degree  all lines and wrinkles  nine grey hairs of a side  and nothing but a dab of powder at top .', ' in the name of heaven  who is that old fellow ', 'said i to a friend of mine who was standing near   sir basil morley .', ' old fellow ', 'cried sir basil   it is admiral baldwin .', 'what do you take his age to be ', ' sixty  said i   or perhaps sixty  two .', ' forty  replied sir basil   forty  and no more .', 'picture to yourselves my amazement  i shall not easily forget admiral baldwin .', 'i never saw quite so wretched an example of what a sea  faring life can do  but to a degree  i know it is the same with them all  they are all knocked about  and exposed to every climate  and every weather  till they are not fit to be seen .', 'it is a pity they are not knocked on the head at once  before they reach admiral baldwin  s age .', ' nay  sir walter  cried mrs clay   this is being severe indeed .', 'have a little mercy on the poor men .', 'we are not all born to be handsome .', 'the sea is no beautifier  certainly  sailors do grow old betimes  i have observed it  they soon lose the look of youth .', 'but then  is not it the same with many other professions  perhaps most other ', 'soldiers  in active service  are not at all better off  and even in the quieter professions  there is a toil and a labour of the mind  if not of the body  which seldom leaves a man  s looks to the natural effect of time .', 'the lawyer plods  quite care  worn  the physician is up at all hours  and travelling in all weather  and even the clergyman  she stopt a moment to consider what might do for the clergyman  and even the clergyman  you know is obliged to go into infected rooms  and expose his health and looks to all the injury of a poisonous atmosphere .', 'in fact  as i have long been convinced  though every profession is necessary and honourable in its turn  it is only the lot of those who are not obliged to follow any  who can live in a regular way  in the country  choosing their own hours  following their own pursuits  and living on their own property  without the torment of trying for more  it is only their lot  i say  to hold the blessings of health and a good appearance to the utmost  i know no other set of men but what lose something of their personableness when they cease to be quite young .', 'it seemed as if mr shepherd  in this anxiety to bespeak sir walter  s good will towards a naval officer as tenant  had been gifted with foresight  for the very first application for the house was from an admiral croft  with whom he shortly afterwards fell into company in attending the quarter sessions at taunton  and indeed  he had received a hint of the admiral from a london correspondent .', 'by the report which he hastened over to kellynch to make  admiral croft was a native of somersetshire  who having acquired a very handsome fortune  was wishing to settle in his own country  and had come down to taunton in order to look at some advertised places in that immediate neighbourhood  which  however  had not suited him  that accidentally hearing  it was just as he had foretold  mr shepherd observed  sir walter  s concerns could not be kept a secret  accidentally hearing of the possibility of kellynch hall being to let  and understanding his  mr shepherd  s  connection with the owner  he had introduced himself to him in order to make particular inquiries  and had  in the course of a pretty long conference  expressed as strong an inclination for the place as a man who knew it only by description could feel  and given mr shepherd  in his explicit account of himself  every proof of his being a most responsible  eligible tenant .', ' and who is admiral croft ', 'was sir walter  s cold suspicious inquiry .', 'mr shepherd answered for his being of a gentleman  s family  and mentioned a place  and anne  after the little pause which followed  added ', ' he is a rear admiral of the white .', 'he was in the trafalgar action  and has been in the east indies since  he was stationed there  i believe  several years .', ' then i take it for granted  observed sir walter   that his face is about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery .', 'mr shepherd hastened to assure him  that admiral croft was a very hale  hearty  well  looking man  a little weather  beaten  to be sure  but not much  and quite the gentleman in all his notions and behaviour  not likely to make the smallest difficulty about terms  only wanted a comfortable home  and to get into it as soon as possible  knew he must pay for his convenience  knew what rent a ready  furnished house of that consequence might fetch  should not have been surprised if sir walter had asked more  had inquired about the manor  would be glad of the deputation  certainly  but made no great point of it  said he sometimes took out a gun  but never killed  quite the gentleman .', 'mr shepherd was eloquent on the subject  pointing out all the circumstances of the admiral  s family  which made him peculiarly desirable as a tenant .', 'he was a married man  and without children  the very state to be wished for .', 'a house was never taken good care of  mr shepherd observed  without a lady  he did not know  whether furniture might not be in danger of suffering as much where there was no lady  as where there were many children .', 'a lady  without a family  was the very best preserver of furniture in the world .', 'he had seen mrs croft  too  she was at taunton with the admiral  and had been present almost all the time they were talking the matter over .', ' and a very well  spoken  genteel  shrewd lady  she seemed to be  continued he   asked more questions about the house  and terms  and taxes  than the admiral himself  and seemed more conversant with business  and moreover  sir walter  i found she was not quite unconnected in this country  any more than her husband  that is to say  she is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once  she told me so herself  sister to the gentleman who lived a few years back at monkford .', 'bless me ', 'what was his name ', 'at this moment i cannot recollect his name  though i have heard it so lately .', 'penelope  my dear  can you help me to the name of the gentleman who lived at monkford  mrs croft  s brother ', 'but mrs clay was talking so eagerly with miss elliot  that she did not hear the appeal .', ' i have no conception whom you can mean  shepherd  i remember no gentleman resident at monkford since the time of old governor trent .', ' bless me ', 'how very odd ', 'i shall forget my own name soon  i suppose .', 'a name that i am so very well acquainted with  knew the gentleman so well by sight  seen him a hundred times  came to consult me once  i remember  about a trespass of one of his neighbours  farmer  s man breaking into his orchard  wall torn down  apples stolen  caught in the fact  and afterwards  contrary to my judgement  submitted to an amicable compromise .', 'very odd indeed ', 'after waiting another moment ', ' you mean mr wentworth  i suppose ', 'said anne .', 'mr shepherd was all gratitude .', ' wentworth was the very name ', 'mr wentworth was the very man .', 'he had the curacy of monkford  you know  sir walter  some time back  for two or three years .', 'came there about the year    i take it .', 'you remember him  i am sure .', ' wentworth ', 'oh ', 'ay  mr wentworth  the curate of monkford .', 'you misled me by the term gentleman .', 'i thought you were speaking of some man of property  mr wentworth was nobody  i remember  quite unconnected  nothing to do with the strafford family .', 'one wonders how the names of many of our nobility become so common .', 'as mr shepherd perceived that this connexion of the crofts did them no service with sir walter  he mentioned it no more  returning  with all his zeal  to dwell on the circumstances more indisputably in their favour  their age  and number  and fortune  the high idea they had formed of kellynch hall  and extreme solicitude for the advantage of renting it  making it appear as if they ranked nothing beyond the happiness of being the tenants of sir walter elliot  an extraordinary taste  certainly  could they have been supposed in the secret of sir walter  s estimate of the dues of a tenant .', 'it succeeded  however  and though sir walter must ever look with an evil eye on anyone intending to inhabit that house  and think them infinitely too well off in being permitted to rent it on the highest terms  he was talked into allowing mr shepherd to proceed in the treaty  and authorising him to wait on admiral croft  who still remained at taunton  and fix a day for the house being seen .', 'sir walter was not very wise  but still he had experience enough of the world to feel  that a more unobjectionable tenant  in all essentials  than admiral croft bid fair to be  could hardly offer .', 'so far went his understanding  and his vanity supplied a little additional soothing  in the admiral  s situation in life  which was just high enough  and not too high .', ' i have let my house to admiral croft  would sound extremely well  very much better than to any mere mr  a mr  save  perhaps  some half dozen in the nation  always needs a note of explanation .', 'an admiral speaks his own consequence  and  at the same time  can never make a baronet look small .', 'in all their dealings and intercourse  sir walter elliot must ever have the precedence .', 'nothing could be done without a reference to elizabeth  but her inclination was growing so strong for a removal  that she was happy to have it fixed and expedited by a tenant at hand  and not a word to suspend decision was uttered by her .', 'mr shepherd was completely empowered to act  and no sooner had such an end been reached  than anne  who had been a most attentive listener to the whole  left the room  to seek the comfort of cool air for her flushed cheeks  and as she walked along a favourite grove  said  with a gentle sigh   a few months more  and he  perhaps  may be walking here .', 'chapter ', 'he was not mr wentworth  the former curate of monkford  however suspicious appearances may be  but a captain frederick wentworth  his brother  who being made commander in consequence of the action off st domingo  and not immediately employed  had come into somersetshire  in the summer of   and having no parent living  found a home for half a year at monkford .', 'he was  at that time  a remarkably fine young man  with a great deal of intelligence  spirit  and brilliancy  and anne an extremely pretty girl  with gentleness  modesty  taste  and feeling .', 'half the sum of attraction  on either side  might have been enough  for he had nothing to do  and she had hardly anybody to love  but the encounter of such lavish recommendations could not fail .', 'they were gradually acquainted  and when acquainted  rapidly and deeply in love .', 'it would be difficult to say which had seen highest perfection in the other  or which had been the happiest  she  in receiving his declarations and proposals  or he in having them accepted .', 'a short period of exquisite felicity followed  and but a short one .', 'troubles soon arose .', 'sir walter  on being applied to  without actually withholding his consent  or saying it should never be  gave it all the negative of great astonishment  great coldness  great silence  and a professed resolution of doing nothing for his daughter .', 'he thought it a very degrading alliance  and lady russell  though with more tempered and pardonable pride  received it as a most unfortunate one .', 'anne elliot  with all her claims of birth  beauty  and mind  to throw herself away at nineteen  involve herself at nineteen in an engagement with a young man  who had nothing but himself to recommend him  and no hopes of attaining affluence  but in the chances of a most uncertain profession  and no connexions to secure even his farther rise in the profession  would be  indeed  a throwing away  which she grieved to think of ', 'anne elliot  so young  known to so few  to be snatched off by a stranger without alliance or fortune  or rather sunk by him into a state of most wearing  anxious  youth  killing dependence ', 'it must not be  if by any fair interference of friendship  any representations from one who had almost a mother  s love  and mother  s rights  it would be prevented .', 'captain wentworth had no fortune .', 'he had been lucky in his profession  but spending freely  what had come freely  had realized nothing .', 'but he was confident that he should soon be rich  full of life and ardour  he knew that he should soon have a ship  and soon be on a station that would lead to everything he wanted .', 'he had always been lucky  he knew he should be so still .', 'such confidence  powerful in its own warmth  and bewitching in the wit which often expressed it  must have been enough for anne  but lady russell saw it very differently .', 'his sanguine temper  and fearlessness of mind  operated very differently on her .', 'she saw in it but an aggravation of the evil .', 'it only added a dangerous character to himself .', 'he was brilliant  he was headstrong .', 'lady russell had little taste for wit  and of anything approaching to imprudence a horror .', 'she deprecated the connexion in every light .', 'such opposition  as these feelings produced  was more than anne could combat .', 'young and gentle as she was  it might yet have been possible to withstand her father  s ill  will  though unsoftened by one kind word or look on the part of her sister  but lady russell  whom she had always loved and relied on  could not  with such steadiness of opinion  and such tenderness of manner  be continually advising her in vain .', 'she was persuaded to believe the engagement a wrong thing  indiscreet  improper  hardly capable of success  and not deserving it .', 'but it was not a merely selfish caution  under which she acted  in putting an end to it .', 'had she not imagined herself consulting his good  even more than her own  she could hardly have given him up .', 'the belief of being prudent  and self  denying  principally for his advantage  was her chief consolation  under the misery of a parting  a final parting  and every consolation was required  for she had to encounter all the additional pain of opinions  on his side  totally unconvinced and unbending  and of his feeling himself ill used by so forced a relinquishment .', 'he had left the country in consequence .', 'a few months had seen the beginning and the end of their acquaintance  but not with a few months ended anne  s share of suffering from it .', 'her attachment and regrets had  for a long time  clouded every enjoyment of youth  and an early loss of bloom and spirits had been their lasting effect .', 'more than seven years were gone since this little history of sorrowful interest had reached its close  and time had softened down much  perhaps nearly all of peculiar attachment to him  but she had been too dependent on time alone  no aid had been given in change of place  except in one visit to bath soon after the rupture  or in any novelty or enlargement of society .', 'no one had ever come within the kellynch circle  who could bear a comparison with frederick wentworth  as he stood in her memory .', 'no second attachment  the only thoroughly natural  happy  and sufficient cure  at her time of life  had been possible to the nice tone of her mind  the fastidiousness of her taste  in the small limits of the society around them .', 'she had been solicited  when about two  and  twenty  to change her name  by the young man  who not long afterwards found a more willing mind in her younger sister  and lady russell had lamented her refusal  for charles musgrove was the eldest son of a man  whose landed property and general importance were second in that country  only to sir walter  s  and of good character and appearance  and however lady russell might have asked yet for something more  while anne was nineteen  she would have rejoiced to see her at twenty  two so respectably removed from the partialities and injustice of her father  s house  and settled so permanently near herself .', 'but in this case  anne had left nothing for advice to do  and though lady russell  as satisfied as ever with her own discretion  never wished the past undone  she began now to have the anxiety which borders on hopelessness for anne  s being tempted  by some man of talents and independence  to enter a state for which she held her to be peculiarly fitted by her warm affections and domestic habits .', 'they knew not each other  s opinion  either its constancy or its change  on the one leading point of anne  s conduct  for the subject was never alluded to  but anne  at seven  and  twenty  thought very differently from what she had been made to think at nineteen .', 'she did not blame lady russell  she did not blame herself for having been guided by her  but she felt that were any young person  in similar circumstances  to apply to her for counsel  they would never receive any of such certain immediate wretchedness  such uncertain future good .', 'she was persuaded that under every disadvantage of disapprobation at home  and every anxiety attending his profession  all their probable fears  delays  and disappointments  she should yet have been a happier woman in maintaining the engagement  than she had been in the sacrifice of it  and this  she fully believed  had the usual share  had even more than the usual share of all such solicitudes and suspense been theirs  without reference to the actual results of their case  which  as it happened  would have bestowed earlier prosperity than could be reasonably calculated on .', 'all his sanguine expectations  all his confidence had been justified .', 'his genius and ardour had seemed to foresee and to command his prosperous path .', 'he had  very soon after their engagement ceased  got employ  and all that he had told her would follow  had taken place .', 'he had distinguished himself  and early gained the other step in rank  and must now  by successive captures  have made a handsome fortune .', 'she had only navy lists and newspapers for her authority  but she could not doubt his being rich  and  in favour of his constancy  she had no reason to believe him married .', 'how eloquent could anne elliot have been ', 'how eloquent  at least  were her wishes on the side of early warm attachment  and a cheerful confidence in futurity  against that over  anxious caution which seems to insult exertion and distrust providence ', 'she had been forced into prudence in her youth  she learned romance as she grew older  the natural sequel of an unnatural beginning .', 'with all these circumstances  recollections and feelings  she could not hear that captain wentworth  s sister was likely to live at kellynch without a revival of former pain  and many a stroll  and many a sigh  were necessary to dispel the agitation of the idea .', 'she often told herself it was folly  before she could harden her nerves sufficiently to feel the continual discussion of the crofts and their business no evil .', 'she was assisted  however  by that perfect indifference and apparent unconsciousness  among the only three of her own friends in the secret of the past  which seemed almost to deny any recollection of it .', 'she could do justice to the superiority of lady russell  s motives in this  over those of her father and elizabeth  she could honour all the better feelings of her calmness  but the general air of oblivion among them was highly important from whatever it sprung  and in the event of admiral croft  s really taking kellynch hall  she rejoiced anew over the conviction which had always been most grateful to her  of the past being known to those three only among her connexions  by whom no syllable  she believed  would ever be whispered  and in the trust that among his  the brother only with whom he had been residing  had received any information of their short  lived engagement .', 'that brother had been long removed from the country and being a sensible man  and  moreover  a single man at the time  she had a fond dependence on no human creature  s having heard of it from him .', 'the sister  mrs croft  had then been out of england  accompanying her husband on a foreign station  and her own sister  mary  had been at school while it all occurred  and never admitted by the pride of some  and the delicacy of others  to the smallest knowledge of it afterwards .', 'with these supports  she hoped that the acquaintance between herself and the crofts  which  with lady russell  still resident in kellynch  and mary fixed only three miles off  must be anticipated  need not involve any particular awkwardness .', 'chapter ', 'on the morning appointed for admiral and mrs croft  s seeing kellynch hall  anne found it most natural to take her almost daily walk to lady russell  s  and keep out of the way till all was over  when she found it most natural to be sorry that she had missed the opportunity of seeing them .', 'this meeting of the two parties proved highly satisfactory  and decided the whole business at once .', 'each lady was previously well disposed for an agreement  and saw nothing  therefore  but good manners in the other  and with regard to the gentlemen  there was such an hearty good humour  such an open  trusting liberality on the admiral  s side  as could not but influence sir walter  who had besides been flattered into his very best and most polished behaviour by mr shepherd  s assurances of his being known  by report  to the admiral  as a model of good breeding .', 'the house and grounds  and furniture  were approved  the crofts were approved  terms  time  every thing  and every body  was right  and mr shepherd  s clerks were set to work  without there having been a single preliminary difference to modify of all that  this indenture sheweth .', 'sir walter  without hesitation  declared the admiral to be the best  looking sailor he had ever met with  and went so far as to say  that if his own man might have had the arranging of his hair  he should not be ashamed of being seen with him any where  and the admiral  with sympathetic cordiality  observed to his wife as they drove back through the park   i thought we should soon come to a deal  my dear  in spite of what they told us at taunton .', 'the baronet will never set the thames on fire  but there seems to be no harm in him .', 'reciprocal compliments  which would have been esteemed about equal .', 'the crofts were to have possession at michaelmas  and as sir walter proposed removing to bath in the course of the preceding month  there was no time to be lost in making every dependent arrangement .', 'lady russell  convinced that anne would not be allowed to be of any use  or any importance  in the choice of the house which they were going to secure  was very unwilling to have her hurried away so soon  and wanted to make it possible for her to stay behind till she might convey her to bath herself after christmas  but having engagements of her own which must take her from kellynch for several weeks  she was unable to give the full invitation she wished  and anne though dreading the possible heats of september in all the white glare of bath  and grieving to forego all the influence so sweet and so sad of the autumnal months in the country  did not think that  everything considered  she wished to remain .', 'it would be most right  and most wise  and  therefore must involve least suffering to go with the others .', 'something occurred  however  to give her a different duty .', 'mary  often a little unwell  and always thinking a great deal of her own complaints  and always in the habit of claiming anne when anything was the matter  was indisposed  and foreseeing that she should not have a day  s health all the autumn  entreated  or rather required her  for it was hardly entreaty  to come to uppercross cottage  and bear her company as long as she should want her  instead of going to bath .', ' i cannot possibly do without anne  was mary  s reasoning  and elizabeth  s reply was   then i am sure anne had better stay  for nobody will want her in bath .', 'to be claimed as a good  though in an improper style  is at least better than being rejected as no good at all  and anne  glad to be thought of some use  glad to have anything marked out as a duty  and certainly not sorry to have the scene of it in the country  and her own dear country  readily agreed to stay .', 'this invitation of mary  s removed all lady russell  s difficulties  and it was consequently soon settled that anne should not go to bath till lady russell took her  and that all the intervening time should be divided between uppercross cottage and kellynch lodge .', 'so far all was perfectly right  but lady russell was almost startled by the wrong of one part of the kellynch hall plan  when it burst on her  which was  mrs clay  s being engaged to go to bath with sir walter and elizabeth  as a most important and valuable assistant to the latter in all the business before her .', 'lady russell was extremely sorry that such a measure should have been resorted to at all  wondered  grieved  and feared  and the affront it contained to anne  in mrs clay  s being of so much use  while anne could be of none  was a very sore aggravation .', 'anne herself was become hardened to such affronts  but she felt the imprudence of the arrangement quite as keenly as lady russell .', 'with a great deal of quiet observation  and a knowledge  which she often wished less  of her father  s character  she was sensible that results the most serious to his family from the intimacy were more than possible .', 'she did not imagine that her father had at present an idea of the kind .', 'mrs clay had freckles  and a projecting tooth  and a clumsy wrist  which he was continually making severe remarks upon  in her absence  but she was young  and certainly altogether well  looking  and possessed  in an acute mind and assiduous pleasing manners  infinitely more dangerous attractions than any merely personal might have been .', 'anne was so impressed by the degree of their danger  that she could not excuse herself from trying to make it perceptible to her sister .', 'she had little hope of success  but elizabeth  who in the event of such a reverse would be so much more to be pitied than herself  should never  she thought  have reason to reproach her for giving no warning .', 'she spoke  and seemed only to offend .', 'elizabeth could not conceive how such an absurd suspicion should occur to her  and indignantly answered for each party  s perfectly knowing their situation .', ' mrs clay  said she  warmly   never forgets who she is  and as i am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be  i can assure you  that upon the subject of marriage they are particularly nice  and that she reprobates all inequality of condition and rank more strongly than most people .', 'and as to my father  i really should not have thought that he  who has kept himself single so long for our sakes  need be suspected now .', 'if mrs clay were a very beautiful woman  i grant you  it might be wrong to have her so much with me  not that anything in the world  i am sure  would induce my father to make a degrading match  but he might be rendered unhappy .', 'but poor mrs clay who  with all her merits  can never have been reckoned tolerably pretty  i really think poor mrs clay may be staying here in perfect safety .', 'one would imagine you had never heard my father speak of her personal misfortunes  though i know you must fifty times .', 'that tooth of her  s and those freckles .', 'freckles do not disgust me so very much as they do him .', 'i have known a face not materially disfigured by a few  but he abominates them .', 'you must have heard him notice mrs clay  s freckles .', ' there is hardly any personal defect  replied anne   which an agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to .', ' i think very differently  answered elizabeth  shortly   an agreeable manner may set off handsome features  but can never alter plain ones .', 'however  at any rate  as i have a great deal more at stake on this point than anybody else can have  i think it rather unnecessary in you to be advising me .', 'anne had done  glad that it was over  and not absolutely hopeless of doing good .', 'elizabeth  though resenting the suspicion  might yet be made observant by it .', 'the last office of the four carriage  horses was to draw sir walter  miss elliot  and mrs clay to bath .', 'the party drove off in very good spirits  sir walter prepared with condescending bows for all the afflicted tenantry and cottagers who might have had a hint to show themselves  and anne walked up at the same time  in a sort of desolate tranquillity  to the lodge  where she was to spend the first week .', 'her friend was not in better spirits than herself .', 'lady russell felt this break  up of the family exceedingly .', 'their respectability was as dear to her as her own  and a daily intercourse had become precious by habit .', 'it was painful to look upon their deserted grounds  and still worse to anticipate the new hands they were to fall into  and to escape the solitariness and the melancholy of so altered a village  and be out of the way when admiral and mrs croft first arrived  she had determined to make her own absence from home begin when she must give up anne .', 'accordingly their removal was made together  and anne was set down at uppercross cottage  in the first stage of lady russell  s journey .', 'uppercross was a moderate  sized village  which a few years back had been completely in the old english style  containing only two houses superior in appearance to those of the yeomen and labourers  the mansion of the squire  with its high walls  great gates  and old trees  substantial and unmodernized  and the compact  tight parsonage  enclosed in its own neat garden  with a vine and a pear  tree trained round its casements  but upon the marriage of the young  squire  it had received the improvement of a farm  house elevated into a cottage  for his residence  and uppercross cottage  with its veranda  french windows  and other prettiness  was quite as likely to catch the traveller  s eye as the more consistent and considerable aspect and premises of the great house  about a quarter of a mile farther on .', 'here anne had often been staying .', 'she knew the ways of uppercross as well as those of kellynch .', 'the two families were so continually meeting  so much in the habit of running in and out of each other  s house at all hours  that it was rather a surprise to her to find mary alone  but being alone  her being unwell and out of spirits was almost a matter of course .', 'though better endowed than the elder sister  mary had not anne  s understanding nor temper .', 'while well  and happy  and properly attended to  she had great good humour and excellent spirits  but any indisposition sunk her completely .', 'she had no resources for solitude  and inheriting a considerable share of the elliot self  importance  was very prone to add to every other distress that of fancying herself neglected and ill  used .', 'in person  she was inferior to both sisters  and had  even in her bloom  only reached the dignity of being  a fine girl .', 'she was now lying on the faded sofa of the pretty little drawing  room  the once elegant furniture of which had been gradually growing shabby  under the influence of four summers and two children  and  on anne  s appearing  greeted her with ', ' so  you are come at last ', 'i began to think i should never see you .', 'i am so ill i can hardly speak .', 'i have not seen a creature the whole morning ', ' i am sorry to find you unwell  replied anne .', ' you sent me such a good account of yourself on thursday ', ' yes  i made the best of it  i always do  but i was very far from well at the time  and i do not think i ever was so ill in my life as i have been all this morning  very unfit to be left alone  i am sure .', 'suppose i were to be seized of a sudden in some dreadful way  and not able to ring the bell ', 'so  lady russell would not get out .', 'i do not think she has been in this house three times this summer .', 'anne said what was proper  and enquired after her husband .', ' oh ', 'charles is out shooting .', 'i have not seen him since seven o  clock .', 'he would go  though i told him how ill i was .', 'he said he should not stay out long  but he has never come back  and now it is almost one .', 'i assure you  i have not seen a soul this whole long morning .', ' you have had your little boys with you ', ' yes  as long as i could bear their noise  but they are so unmanageable that they do me more harm than good .', 'little charles does not mind a word i say  and walter is growing quite as bad .', ' well  you will soon be better now  replied anne  cheerfully .', ' you know i always cure you when i come .', 'how are your neighbours at the great house ', ' i can give you no account of them .', 'i have not seen one of them to  day  except mr musgrove  who just stopped and spoke through the window  but without getting off his horse  and though i told him how ill i was  not one of them have been near me .', 'it did not happen to suit the miss musgroves  i suppose  and they never put themselves out of their way .', ' you will see them yet  perhaps  before the morning is gone .', 'it is early .', ' i never want them  i assure you .', 'they talk and laugh a great deal too much for me .', 'oh ', 'anne  i am so very unwell ', 'it was quite unkind of you not to come on thursday .', ' my dear mary  recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of yourself ', 'you wrote in the cheerfullest manner  and said you were perfectly well  and in no hurry for me  and that being the case  you must be aware that my wish would be to remain with lady russell to the last  and besides what i felt on her account  i have really been so busy  have had so much to do  that i could not very conveniently have left kellynch sooner .', ' dear me ', 'what can you possibly have to do ', ' a great many things  i assure you .', 'more than i can recollect in a moment  but i can tell you some .', 'i have been making a duplicate of the catalogue of my father  s books and pictures .', 'i have been several times in the garden with mackenzie  trying to understand  and make him understand  which of elizabeth  s plants are for lady russell .', 'i have had all my own little concerns to arrange  books and music to divide  and all my trunks to repack  from not having understood in time what was intended as to the waggons  and one thing i have had to do  mary  of a more trying nature  going to almost every house in the parish  as a sort of take  leave .', 'i was told that they wished it .', 'but all these things took up a great deal of time .', ' oh ', 'well ', 'and after a moment  s pause   but you have never asked me one word about our dinner at the pooles yesterday .', ' did you go then ', 'i have made no enquiries  because i concluded you must have been obliged to give up the party .', ' oh yes ', 'i went .', 'i was very well yesterday  nothing at all the matter with me till this morning .', 'it would have been strange if i had not gone .', ' i am very glad you were well enough  and i hope you had a pleasant party .', ' nothing remarkable .', 'one always knows beforehand what the dinner will be  and who will be there  and it is so very uncomfortable not having a carriage of one  s own .', 'mr and mrs musgrove took me  and we were so crowded ', 'they are both so very large  and take up so much room  and mr musgrove always sits forward .', 'so  there was i  crowded into the back seat with henrietta and louise  and i think it very likely that my illness to  day may be owing to it .', 'a little further perseverance in patience and forced cheerfulness on anne  s side produced nearly a cure on mary  s .', 'she could soon sit upright on the sofa  and began to hope she might be able to leave it by dinner  time .', 'then  forgetting to think of it  she was at the other end of the room  beautifying a nosegay  then  she ate her cold meat  and then she was well enough to propose a little walk .', ' where shall we go ', 'said she  when they were ready .', ' i suppose you will not like to call at the great house before they have been to see you ', ' i have not the smallest objection on that account  replied anne .', ' i should never think of standing on such ceremony with people i know so well as mrs and the miss musgroves .', ' oh ', 'but they ought to call upon you as soon as possible .', 'they ought to feel what is due to you as my sister .', 'however  we may as well go and sit with them a little while  and when we have that over  we can enjoy our walk .', 'anne had always thought such a style of intercourse highly imprudent  but she had ceased to endeavour to check it  from believing that  though there were on each side continual subjects of offence  neither family could now do without it .', 'to the great house accordingly they went  to sit the full half hour in the old  fashioned square parlour  with a small carpet and shining floor  to which the present daughters of the house were gradually giving the proper air of confusion by a grand piano  forte and a harp  flower  stands and little tables placed in every direction .', 'oh ', 'could the originals of the portraits against the wainscot  could the gentlemen in brown velvet and the ladies in blue satin have seen what was going on  have been conscious of such an overthrow of all order and neatness ', 'the portraits themselves seemed to be staring in astonishment .', 'the musgroves  like their houses  were in a state of alteration  perhaps of improvement .', 'the father and mother were in the old english style  and the young people in the new .', 'mr and mrs musgrove were a very good sort of people  friendly and hospitable  not much educated  and not at all elegant .', 'their children had more modern minds and manners .', 'there was a numerous family  but the only two grown up  excepting charles  were henrietta and louisa  young ladies of nineteen and twenty  who had brought from school at exeter all the usual stock of accomplishments  and were now like thousands of other young ladies  living to be fashionable  happy  and merry .', 'their dress had every advantage  their faces were rather pretty  their spirits extremely good  their manner unembarrassed and pleasant  they were of consequence at home  and favourites abroad .', 'anne always contemplated them as some of the happiest creatures of her acquaintance  but still  saved as we all are  by some comfortable feeling of superiority from wishing for the possibility of exchange  she would not have given up her own more elegant and cultivated mind for all their enjoyments  and envied them nothing but that seemingly perfect good understanding and agreement together  that good  humoured mutual affection  of which she had known so little herself with either of her sisters .', 'they were received with great cordiality .', 'nothing seemed amiss on the side of the great house family  which was generally  as anne very well knew  the least to blame .', 'the half hour was chatted away pleasantly enough  and she was not at all surprised at the end of it  to have their walking party joined by both the miss musgroves  at mary  s particular invitation .', 'chapter ', 'anne had not wanted this visit to uppercross  to learn that a removal from one set of people to another  though at a distance of only three miles  will often include a total change of conversation  opinion  and idea .', 'she had never been staying there before  without being struck by it  or without wishing that other elliots could have her advantage in seeing how unknown  or unconsidered there  were the affairs which at kellynch hall were treated as of such general publicity and pervading interest  yet  with all this experience  she believed she must now submit to feel that another lesson  in the art of knowing our own nothingness beyond our own circle  was become necessary for her  for certainly  coming as she did  with a heart full of the subject which had been completely occupying both houses in kellynch for many weeks  she had expected rather more curiosity and sympathy than she found in the separate but very similar remark of mr and mrs musgrove   so  miss anne  sir walter and your sister are gone  and what part of bath do you think they will settle in ', 'and this  without much waiting for an answer  or in the young ladies  addition of   i hope we shall be in bath in the winter  but remember  papa  if we do go  we must be in a good situation  none of your queen squares for us ', 'or in the anxious supplement from mary  of   upon my word  i shall be pretty well off  when you are all gone away to be happy at bath ', 'she could only resolve to avoid such self  delusion in future  and think with heightened gratitude of the extraordinary blessing of having one such truly sympathising friend as lady russell .', 'the mr musgroves had their own game to guard  and to destroy  their own horses  dogs  and newspapers to engage them  and the females were fully occupied in all the other common subjects of housekeeping  neighbours  dress  dancing  and music .', 'she acknowledged it to be very fitting  that every little social commonwealth should dictate its own matters of discourse  and hoped  ere long  to become a not unworthy member of the one she was now transplanted into .', 'with the prospect of spending at least two months at uppercross  it was highly incumbent on her to clothe her imagination  her memory  and all her ideas in as much of uppercross as possible .', 'she had no dread of these two months .', 'mary was not so repulsive and unsisterly as elizabeth  nor so inaccessible to all influence of hers  neither was there anything among the other component parts of the cottage inimical to comfort .', 'she was always on friendly terms with her brother  in  law  and in the children  who loved her nearly as well  and respected her a great deal more than their mother  she had an object of interest  amusement  and wholesome exertion .', 'charles musgrove was civil and agreeable  in sense and temper he was undoubtedly superior to his wife  but not of powers  or conversation  or grace  to make the past  as they were connected together  at all a dangerous contemplation  though  at the same time  anne could believe  with lady russell  that a more equal match might have greatly improved him  and that a woman of real understanding might have given more consequence to his character  and more usefulness  rationality  and elegance to his habits and pursuits .', 'as it was  he did nothing with much zeal  but sport  and his time was otherwise trifled away  without benefit from books or anything else .', 'he had very good spirits  which never seemed much affected by his wife  s occasional lowness  bore with her unreasonableness sometimes to anne  s admiration  and upon the whole  though there was very often a little disagreement  in which she had sometimes more share than she wished  being appealed to by both parties  they might pass for a happy couple .', 'they were always perfectly agreed in the want of more money  and a strong inclination for a handsome present from his father  but here  as on most topics  he had the superiority  for while mary thought it a great shame that such a present was not made  he always contended for his father  s having many other uses for his money  and a right to spend it as he liked .', 'as to the management of their children  his theory was much better than his wife  s  and his practice not so bad .', ' i could manage them very well  if it were not for mary  s interference  was what anne often heard him say  and had a good deal of faith in  but when listening in turn to mary  s reproach of  charles spoils the children so that i cannot get them into any order  she never had the smallest temptation to say   very true .', 'one of the least agreeable circumstances of her residence there was her being treated with too much confidence by all parties  and being too much in the secret of the complaints of each house .', 'known to have some influence with her sister  she was continually requested  or at least receiving hints to exert it  beyond what was practicable .', ' i wish you could persuade mary not to be always fancying herself ill  was charles  s language  and  in an unhappy mood  thus spoke mary   i do believe if charles were to see me dying  he would not think there was anything the matter with me .', 'i am sure  anne  if you would  you might persuade him that i really am very ill  a great deal worse than i ever own .', 'mary  s declaration was   i hate sending the children to the great house  though their grandmamma is always wanting to see them  for she humours and indulges them to such a degree  and gives them so much trash and sweet things  that they are sure to come back sick and cross for the rest of the day .', 'and mrs musgrove took the first opportunity of being alone with anne  to say   oh ', 'miss anne  i cannot help wishing mrs charles had a little of your method with those children .', 'they are quite different creatures with you ', 'but to be sure  in general they are so spoilt ', 'it is a pity you cannot put your sister in the way of managing them .', 'they are as fine healthy children as ever were seen  poor little dears ', 'without partiality  but mrs charles knows no more how they should be treated ', 'bless me ', 'how troublesome they are sometimes .', 'i assure you  miss anne  it prevents my wishing to see them at our house so often as i otherwise should .', 'i believe mrs charles is not quite pleased with my not inviting them oftener  but you know it is very bad to have children with one that one is obligated to be checking every moment   don  t do this  and  don  t do that  or that one can only keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good for them .', 'she had this communication  moreover  from mary .', ' mrs musgrove thinks all her servants so steady  that it would be high treason to call it in question  but i am sure  without exaggeration  that her upper house  maid and laundry  maid  instead of being in their business  are gadding about the village  all day long .', 'i meet them wherever i go  and i declare  i never go twice into my nursery without seeing something of them .', 'if jemima were not the trustiest  steadiest creature in the world  it would be enough to spoil her  for she tells me  they are always tempting her to take a walk with them .', 'and on mrs musgrove  s side  it was   i make a rule of never interfering in any of my daughter  in  law  s concerns  for i know it would not do  but i shall tell you  miss anne  because you may be able to set things to rights  that i have no very good opinion of mrs charles  s nursery  maid  i hear strange stories of her  she is always upon the gad  and from my own knowledge  i can declare  she is such a fine  dressing lady  that she is enough to ruin any servants she comes near .', 'mrs charles quite swears by her  i know  but i just give you this hint  that you may be upon the watch  because  if you see anything amiss  you need not be afraid of mentioning it .', 'again  it was mary  s complaint  that mrs musgrove was very apt not to give her the precedence that was her due  when they dined at the great house with other families  and she did not see any reason why she was to be considered so much at home as to lose her place .', 'and one day when anne was walking with only the musgroves  one of them after talking of rank  people of rank  and jealousy of rank  said   i have no scruple of observing to you  how nonsensical some persons are about their place  because all the world knows how easy and indifferent you are about it  but i wish anybody could give mary a hint that it would be a great deal better if she were not so very tenacious  especially if she would not be always putting herself forward to take place of mamma .', 'nobody doubts her right to have precedence of mamma  but it would be more becoming in her not to be always insisting on it .', 'it is not that mamma cares about it the least in the world  but i know it is taken notice of by many persons .', 'how was anne to set all these matters to rights ', 'she could do little more than listen patiently  soften every grievance  and excuse each to the other  give them all hints of the forbearance necessary between such near neighbours  and make those hints broadest which were meant for her sister  s benefit .', 'in all other respects  her visit began and proceeded very well .', 'her own spirits improved by change of place and subject  by being removed three miles from kellynch  mary  s ailments lessened by having a constant companion  and their daily intercourse with the other family  since there was neither superior affection  confidence  nor employment in the cottage  to be interrupted by it  was rather an advantage .', 'it was certainly carried nearly as far as possible  for they met every morning  and hardly ever spent an evening asunder  but she believed they should not have done so well without the sight of mr and mrs musgrove  s respectable forms in the usual places  or without the talking  laughing  and singing of their daughters .', 'she played a great deal better than either of the miss musgroves  but having no voice  no knowledge of the harp  and no fond parents  to sit by and fancy themselves delighted  her performance was little thought of  only out of civility  or to refresh the others  as she was well aware .', 'she knew that when she played she was giving pleasure only to herself  but this was no new sensation .', 'excepting one short period of her life  she had never  since the age of fourteen  never since the loss of her dear mother  known the happiness of being listened to  or encouraged by any just appreciation or real taste .', 'in music she had been always used to feel alone in the world  and mr and mrs musgrove  s fond partiality for their own daughters  performance  and total indifference to any other person  s  gave her much more pleasure for their sakes  than mortification for her own .', 'the party at the great house was sometimes increased by other company .', 'the neighbourhood was not large  but the musgroves were visited by everybody  and had more dinner  parties  and more callers  more visitors by invitation and by chance  than any other family .', 'there were more completely popular .', 'the girls were wild for dancing  and the evenings ended  occasionally  in an unpremeditated little ball .', 'there was a family of cousins within a walk of uppercross  in less affluent circumstances  who depended on the musgroves for all their pleasures  they would come at any time  and help play at anything  or dance anywhere  and anne  very much preferring the office of musician to a more active post  played country dances to them by the hour together  a kindness which always recommended her musical powers to the notice of mr and mrs musgrove more than anything else  and often drew this compliment   well done  miss anne ', 'very well done indeed ', 'lord bless me ', 'how those little fingers of yours fly about ', 'so passed the first three weeks .', 'michaelmas came  and now anne  s heart must be in kellynch again .', 'a beloved home made over to others  all the precious rooms and furniture  groves  and prospects  beginning to own other eyes and other limbs ', 'she could not think of much else on the th of september  and she had this sympathetic touch in the evening from mary  who  on having occasion to note down the day of the month  exclaimed   dear me  is not this the day the crofts were to come to kellynch ', 'i am glad i did not think of it before .', 'how low it makes me ', 'the crofts took possession with true naval alertness  and were to be visited .', 'mary deplored the necessity for herself .', ' nobody knew how much she should suffer .', 'she should put it off as long as she could  but was not easy till she had talked charles into driving her over on an early day  and was in a very animated  comfortable state of imaginary agitation  when she came back .', 'anne had very sincerely rejoiced in there being no means of her going .', 'she wished  however to see the crofts  and was glad to be within when the visit was returned .', 'they came  the master of the house was not at home  but the two sisters were together  and as it chanced that mrs croft fell to the share of anne  while the admiral sat by mary  and made himself very agreeable by his good  humoured notice of her little boys  she was well able to watch for a likeness  and if it failed her in the features  to catch it in the voice  or in the turn of sentiment and expression .', 'mrs croft  though neither tall nor fat  had a squareness  uprightness  and vigour of form  which gave importance to her person .', 'she had bright dark eyes  good teeth  and altogether an agreeable face  though her reddened and weather  beaten complexion  the consequence of her having been almost as much at sea as her husband  made her seem to have lived some years longer in the world than her real eight  and  thirty .', 'her manners were open  easy  and decided  like one who had no distrust of herself  and no doubts of what to do  without any approach to coarseness  however  or any want of good humour .', 'anne gave her credit  indeed  for feelings of great consideration towards herself  in all that related to kellynch  and it pleased her  especially  as she had satisfied herself in the very first half minute  in the instant even of introduction  that there was not the smallest symptom of any knowledge or suspicion on mrs croft  s side  to give a bias of any sort .', 'she was quite easy on that head  and consequently full of strength and courage  till for a moment electrified by mrs croft  s suddenly saying ', ' it was you  and not your sister  i find  that my brother had the pleasure of being acquainted with  when he was in this country .', 'anne hoped she had outlived the age of blushing  but the age of emotion she certainly had not .', ' perhaps you may not have heard that he is married ', 'added mrs croft .', 'she could now answer as she ought  and was happy to feel  when mrs croft  s next words explained it to be mr wentworth of whom she spoke  that she had said nothing which might not do for either brother .', 'she immediately felt how reasonable it was  that mrs croft should be thinking and speaking of edward  and not of frederick  and with shame at her own forgetfulness applied herself to the knowledge of their former neighbour  s present state with proper interest .', 'the rest was all tranquillity  till  just as they were moving  she heard the admiral say to mary ', ' we are expecting a brother of mrs croft  s here soon  i dare say you know him by name .', 'he was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boys  clinging to him like an old friend  and declaring he should not go  and being too much engrossed by proposals of carrying them away in his coat pockets   c . to have another moment for finishing or recollecting what he had begun  anne was left to persuade herself  as well as she could  that the same brother must still be in question .', 'she could not  however  reach such a degree of certainty  as not to be anxious to hear whether anything had been said on the subject at the other house  where the crofts had previously been calling .', 'the folks of the great house were to spend the evening of this day at the cottage  and it being now too late in the year for such visits to be made on foot  the coach was beginning to be listened for  when the youngest miss musgrove walked in .', 'that she was coming to apologize  and that they should have to spend the evening by themselves  was the first black idea  and mary was quite ready to be affronted  when louisa made all right by saying  that she only came on foot  to leave more room for the harp  which was bringing in the carriage .', ' and i will tell you our reason  she added   and all about it .', 'i am come on to give you notice  that papa and mamma are out of spirits this evening  especially mamma  she is thinking so much of poor richard ', 'and we agreed it would be best to have the harp  for it seems to amuse her more than the piano  forte .', 'i will tell you why she is out of spirits .', 'when the crofts called this morning   they called here afterwards  did not they ', ' they happened to say  that her brother  captain wentworth  is just returned to england  or paid off  or something  and is coming to see them almost directly  and most unluckily it came into mamma  s head  when they were gone  that wentworth  or something very like it  was the name of poor richard  s captain at one time  i do not know when or where  but a great while before he died  poor fellow ', 'and upon looking over his letters and things  she found it was so  and is perfectly sure that this must be the very man  and her head is quite full of it  and of poor richard ', 'so we must be as merry as we can  that she may not be dwelling upon such gloomy things .', 'the real circumstances of this pathetic piece of family history were  that the musgroves had had the ill fortune of a very troublesome  hopeless son  and the good fortune to lose him before he reached his twentieth year  that he had been sent to sea because he was stupid and unmanageable on shore  that he had been very little cared for at any time by his family  though quite as much as he deserved  seldom heard of  and scarcely at all regretted  when the intelligence of his death abroad had worked its way to uppercross  two years before .', 'he had  in fact  though his sisters were now doing all they could for him  by calling him  poor richard  been nothing better than a thick  headed  unfeeling  unprofitable dick musgrove  who had never done anything to entitle himself to more than the abbreviation of his name  living or dead .', 'he had been several years at sea  and had  in the course of those removals to which all midshipmen are liable  and especially such midshipmen as every captain wishes to get rid of  been six months on board captain frederick wentworth  s frigate  the laconia  and from the laconia he had  under the influence of his captain  written the only two letters which his father and mother had ever received from him during the whole of his absence  that is to say  the only two disinterested letters  all the rest had been mere applications for money .', 'in each letter he had spoken well of his captain  but yet  so little were they in the habit of attending to such matters  so unobservant and incurious were they as to the names of men or ships  that it had made scarcely any impression at the time  and that mrs musgrove should have been suddenly struck  this very day  with a recollection of the name of wentworth  as connected with her son  seemed one of those extraordinary bursts of mind which do sometimes occur .', 'she had gone to her letters  and found it all as she supposed  and the re  perusal of these letters  after so long an interval  her poor son gone for ever  and all the strength of his faults forgotten  had affected her spirits exceedingly  and thrown her into greater grief for him than she had know on first hearing of his death .', 'mr musgrove was  in a lesser degree  affected likewise  and when they reached the cottage  they were evidently in want  first  of being listened to anew on this subject  and afterwards  of all the relief which cheerful companions could give them .', 'to hear them talking so much of captain wentworth  repeating his name so often  puzzling over past years  and at last ascertaining that it might  that it probably would  turn out to be the very same captain wentworth whom they recollected meeting  once or twice  after their coming back from clifton  a very fine young man  but they could not say whether it was seven or eight years ago  was a new sort of trial to anne  s nerves .', 'she found  however  that it was one to which she must inure herself .', 'since he actually was expected in the country  she must teach herself to be insensible on such points .', 'and not only did it appear that he was expected  and speedily  but the musgroves  in their warm gratitude for the kindness he had shewn poor dick  and very high respect for his character  stamped as it was by poor dick  s having been six months under his care  and mentioning him in strong  though not perfectly well  spelt praise  as  a fine dashing felow  only two perticular about the schoolmaster  were bent on introducing themselves  and seeking his acquaintance  as soon as they could hear of his arrival .', 'the resolution of doing so helped to form the comfort of their evening .', 'chapter ', 'a very few days more  and captain wentworth was known to be at kellynch  and mr musgrove had called on him  and come back warm in his praise  and he was engaged with the crofts to dine at uppercross  by the end of another week .', 'it had been a great disappointment to mr musgrove to find that no earlier day could be fixed  so impatient was he to shew his gratitude  by seeing captain wentworth under his own roof  and welcoming him to all that was strongest and best in his cellars .', 'but a week must pass  only a week  in anne  s reckoning  and then  she supposed  they must meet  and soon she began to wish that she could feel secure even for a week .', 'captain wentworth made a very early return to mr musgrove  s civility  and she was all but calling there in the same half hour .', 'she and mary were actually setting forward for the great house  where  as she afterwards learnt  they must inevitably have found him  when they were stopped by the eldest boy  s being at that moment brought home in consequence of a bad fall .', 'the child  s situation put the visit entirely aside  but she could not hear of her escape with indifference  even in the midst of the serious anxiety which they afterwards felt on his account .', 'his collar  bone was found to be dislocated  and such injury received in the back  as roused the most alarming ideas .', 'it was an afternoon of distress  and anne had every thing to do at once  the apothecary to send for  the father to have pursued and informed  the mother to support and keep from hysterics  the servants to control  the youngest child to banish  and the poor suffering one to attend and soothe  besides sending  as soon as she recollected it  proper notice to the other house  which brought her an accession rather of frightened  enquiring companions  than of very useful assistants .', 'her brother  s return was the first comfort  he could take best care of his wife  and the second blessing was the arrival of the apothecary .', 'till he came and had examined the child  their apprehensions were the worse for being vague  they suspected great injury  but knew not where  but now the collar  bone was soon replaced  and though mr robinson felt and felt  and rubbed  and looked grave  and spoke low words both to the father and the aunt  still they were all to hope the best  and to be able to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind  and then it was  just before they parted  that the two young aunts were able so far to digress from their nephew  s state  as to give the information of captain wentworth  s visit  staying five minutes behind their father and mother  to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted they were with him  how much handsomer  how infinitely more agreeable they thought him than any individual among their male acquaintance  who had been at all a favourite before .', 'how glad they had been to hear papa invite him to stay dinner  how sorry when he said it was quite out of his power  and how glad again when he had promised in reply to papa and mamma  s farther pressing invitations to come and dine with them on the morrow  actually on the morrow  and he had promised it in so pleasant a manner  as if he felt all the motive of their attention just as he ought .', 'and in short  he had looked and said everything with such exquisite grace  that they could assure them all  their heads were both turned by him  and off they ran  quite as full of glee as of love  and apparently more full of captain wentworth than of little charles .', 'the same story and the same raptures were repeated  when the two girls came with their father  through the gloom of the evening  to make enquiries  and mr musgrove  no longer under the first uneasiness about his heir  could add his confirmation and praise  and hope there would be now no occasion for putting captain wentworth off  and only be sorry to think that the cottage party  probably  would not like to leave the little boy  to give him the meeting .', ' oh no  as to leaving the little boy  both father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm to bear the thought  and anne  in the joy of the escape  could not help adding her warm protestations to theirs .', 'charles musgrove  indeed  afterwards  shewed more of inclination   the child was going on so well  and he wished so much to be introduced to captain wentworth  that  perhaps  he might join them in the evening  he would not dine from home  but he might walk in for half an hour .', 'but in this he was eagerly opposed by his wife  with  oh ', 'no  indeed  charles  i cannot bear to have you go away .', 'only think if anything should happen ', 'the child had a good night  and was going on well the next day .', 'it must be a work of time to ascertain that no injury had been done to the spine  but mr robinson found nothing to increase alarm  and charles musgrove began  consequently  to feel no necessity for longer confinement .', 'the child was to be kept in bed and amused as quietly as possible  but what was there for a father to do ', 'this was quite a female case  and it would be highly absurd in him  who could be of no use at home  to shut himself up .', 'his father very much wished him to meet captain wentworth  and there being no sufficient reason against it  he ought to go  and it ended in his making a bold  public declaration  when he came in from shooting  of his meaning to dress directly  and dine at the other house .', ' nothing can be going on better than the child  said he   so i told my father  just now  that i would come  and he thought me quite right .', 'your sister being with you  my love  i have no scruple at all .', 'you would not like to leave him yourself  but you see i can be of no use .', 'anne will send for me if anything is the matter .', 'husbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be vain .', 'mary knew  from charles  s manner of speaking  that he was quite determined on going  and that it would be of no use to teaze him .', 'she said nothing  therefore  till he was out of the room  but as soon as there was only anne to hear ', ' so you and i are to be left to shift by ourselves  with this poor sick child  and not a creature coming near us all the evening ', 'i knew how it would be .', 'this is always my luck .', 'if there is anything disagreeable going on men are always sure to get out of it  and charles is as bad as any of them .', 'very unfeeling ', 'i must say it is very unfeeling of him to be running away from his poor little boy .', 'talks of his being going on so well ', 'how does he know that he is going on well  or that there may not be a sudden change half an hour hence ', 'i did not think charles would have been so unfeeling .', 'so here he is to go away and enjoy himself  and because i am the poor mother  i am not to be allowed to stir  and yet  i am sure  i am more unfit than anybody else to be about the child .', 'my being the mother is the very reason why my feelings should not be tried .', 'i am not at all equal to it .', 'you saw how hysterical i was yesterday .', ' but that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarm  of the shock .', 'you will not be hysterical again .', 'i dare say we shall have nothing to distress us .', 'i perfectly understand mr robinson  s directions  and have no fears  and indeed  mary  i cannot wonder at your husband .', 'nursing does not belong to a man  it is not his province .', 'a sick child is always the mother  s property  her own feelings generally make it so .', ' i hope i am as fond of my child as any mother  but i do not know that i am of any more use in the sick  room than charles  for i cannot be always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill  and you saw  this morning  that if i told him to keep quiet  he was sure to begin kicking about .', 'i have not nerves for the sort of thing .', ' but  could you be comfortable yourself  to be spending the whole evening away from the poor boy ', ' yes  you see his papa can  and why should not i ', 'jemima is so careful  and she could send us word every hour how he was .', 'i really think charles might as well have told his father we would all come .', 'i am not more alarmed about little charles now than he is .', 'i was dreadfully alarmed yesterday  but the case is very different to  day .', ' well  if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself  suppose you were to go  as well as your husband .', 'leave little charles to my care .', 'mr and mrs musgrove cannot think it wrong while i remain with him .', ' are you serious ', 'cried mary  her eyes brightening .', ' dear me ', 'that  s a very good thought  very good  indeed .', 'to be sure  i may just as well go as not  for i am of no use at home  am i ', 'and it only harasses me .', 'you  who have not a mother  s feelings  are a great deal the properest person .', 'you can make little charles do anything  he always minds you at a word .', 'it will be a great deal better than leaving him only with jemima .', 'oh ', 'i shall certainly go  i am sure i ought if i can  quite as much as charles  for they want me excessively to be acquainted with captain wentworth  and i know you do not mind being left alone .', 'an excellent thought of yours  indeed  anne .', 'i will go and tell charles  and get ready directly .', 'you can send for us  you know  at a moment  s notice  if anything is the matter  but i dare say there will be nothing to alarm you .', 'i should not go  you may be sure  if i did not feel quite at ease about my dear child .', 'the next moment she was tapping at her husband  s dressing  room door  and as anne followed her up stairs  she was in time for the whole conversation  which began with mary  s saying  in a tone of great exultation ', ' i mean to go with you  charles  for i am of no more use at home than you are .', 'if i were to shut myself up for ever with the child  i should not be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like .', 'anne will stay  anne undertakes to stay at home and take care of him .', 'it is anne  s own proposal  and so i shall go with you  which will be a great deal better  for i have not dined at the other house since tuesday .', ' this is very kind of anne  was her husband  s answer   and i should be very glad to have you go  but it seems rather hard that she should be left at home by herself  to nurse our sick child .', 'anne was now at hand to take up her own cause  and the sincerity of her manner being soon sufficient to convince him  where conviction was at least very agreeable  he had no farther scruples as to her being left to dine alone  though he still wanted her to join them in the evening  when the child might be at rest for the night  and kindly urged her to let him come and fetch her  but she was quite unpersuadable  and this being the case  she had ere long the pleasure of seeing them set off together in high spirits .', 'they were gone  she hoped  to be happy  however oddly constructed such happiness might seem  as for herself  she was left with as many sensations of comfort  as were  perhaps  ever likely to be hers .', 'she knew herself to be of the first utility to the child  and what was it to her if frederick wentworth were only half a mile distant  making himself agreeable to others ', 'she would have liked to know how he felt as to a meeting .', 'perhaps indifferent  if indifference could exist under such circumstances .', 'he must be either indifferent or unwilling .', 'had he wished ever to see her again  he need not have waited till this time  he would have done what she could not but believe that in his place she should have done long ago  when events had been early giving him the independence which alone had been wanting .', 'her brother and sister came back delighted with their new acquaintance  and their visit in general .', 'there had been music  singing  talking  laughing  all that was most agreeable  charming manners in captain wentworth  no shyness or reserve  they seemed all to know each other perfectly  and he was coming the very next morning to shoot with charles .', 'he was to come to breakfast  but not at the cottage  though that had been proposed at first  but then he had been pressed to come to the great house instead  and he seemed afraid of being in mrs charles musgrove  s way  on account of the child  and therefore  somehow  they hardly knew how  it ended in charles  s being to meet him to breakfast at his father  s .', 'anne understood it .', 'he wished to avoid seeing her .', 'he had inquired after her  she found  slightly  as might suit a former slight acquaintance  seeming to acknowledge such as she had acknowledged  actuated  perhaps  by the same view of escaping introduction when they were to meet .', 'the morning hours of the cottage were always later than those of the other house  and on the morrow the difference was so great that mary and anne were not more than beginning breakfast when charles came in to say that they were just setting off  that he was come for his dogs  that his sisters were following with captain wentworth  his sisters meaning to visit mary and the child  and captain wentworth proposing also to wait on her for a few minutes if not inconvenient  and though charles had answered for the child  s being in no such state as could make it inconvenient  captain wentworth would not be satisfied without his running on to give notice .', 'mary  very much gratified by this attention  was delighted to receive him  while a thousand feelings rushed on anne  of which this was the most consoling  that it would soon be over .', 'and it was soon over .', 'in two minutes after charles  s preparation  the others appeared  they were in the drawing  room .', 'her eye half met captain wentworth  s  a bow  a curtsey passed  she heard his voice  he talked to mary  said all that was right  said something to the miss musgroves  enough to mark an easy footing  the room seemed full  full of persons and voices  but a few minutes ended it .', 'charles shewed himself at the window  all was ready  their visitor had bowed and was gone  the miss musgroves were gone too  suddenly resolving to walk to the end of the village with the sportsmen  the room was cleared  and anne might finish her breakfast as she could .', ' it is over ', 'it is over ', 'she repeated to herself again and again  in nervous gratitude .', ' the worst is over ', 'mary talked  but she could not attend .', 'she had seen him .', 'they had met .', 'they had been once more in the same room .', 'soon  however  she began to reason with herself  and try to be feeling less .', 'eight years  almost eight years had passed  since all had been given up .', 'how absurd to be resuming the agitation which such an interval had banished into distance and indistinctness ', 'what might not eight years do ', 'events of every description  changes  alienations  removals  all  all must be comprised in it  and oblivion of the past  how natural  how certain too ', 'it included nearly a third part of her own life .', 'alas ', 'with all her reasoning  she found  that to retentive feelings eight years may be little more than nothing .', 'now  how were his sentiments to be read ', 'was this like wishing to avoid her ', 'and the next moment she was hating herself for the folly which asked the question .', 'on one other question which perhaps her utmost wisdom might not have prevented  she was soon spared all suspense  for  after the miss musgroves had returned and finished their visit at the cottage she had this spontaneous information from mary  ', ' captain wentworth is not very gallant by you  anne  though he was so attentive to me .', 'henrietta asked him what he thought of you  when they went away  and he said   you were so altered he should not have known you again .', 'mary had no feelings to make her respect her sister  s in a common way  but she was perfectly unsuspicious of being inflicting any peculiar wound .', ' altered beyond his knowledge .', 'anne fully submitted  in silent  deep mortification .', 'doubtless it was so  and she could take no revenge  for he was not altered  or not for the worse .', 'she had already acknowledged it to herself  and she could not think differently  let him think of her as he would .', 'no  the years which had destroyed her youth and bloom had only given him a more glowing  manly  open look  in no respect lessening his personal advantages .', 'she had seen the same frederick wentworth .', ' so altered that he should not have known her again ', 'these were words which could not but dwell with her .', 'yet she soon began to rejoice that she had heard them .', 'they were of sobering tendency  they allayed agitation  they composed  and consequently must make her happier .', 'frederick wentworth had used such words  or something like them  but without an idea that they would be carried round to her .', 'he had thought her wretchedly altered  and in the first moment of appeal  had spoken as he felt .', 'he had not forgiven anne elliot .', 'she had used him ill  deserted and disappointed him  and worse  she had shewn a feebleness of character in doing so  which his own decided  confident temper could not endure .', 'she had given him up to oblige others .', 'it had been the effect of over  persuasion .', 'it had been weakness and timidity .', 'he had been most warmly attached to her  and had never seen a woman since whom he thought her equal  but  except from some natural sensation of curiosity  he had no desire of meeting her again .', 'her power with him was gone for ever .', 'it was now his object to marry .', 'he was rich  and being turned on shore  fully intended to settle as soon as he could be properly tempted  actually looking round  ready to fall in love with all the speed which a clear head and a quick taste could allow .', 'he had a heart for either of the miss musgroves  if they could catch it  a heart  in short  for any pleasing young woman who came in his way  excepting anne elliot .', 'this was his only secret exception  when he said to his sister  in answer to her suppositions ', ' yes  here i am  sophia  quite ready to make a foolish match .', 'anybody between fifteen and thirty may have me for asking .', 'a little beauty  and a few smiles  and a few compliments to the navy  and i am a lost man .', 'should not this be enough for a sailor  who has had no society among women to make him nice ', 'he said it  she knew  to be contradicted .', 'his bright proud eye spoke the conviction that he was nice  and anne elliot was not out of his thoughts  when he more seriously described the woman he should wish to meet with .', ' a strong mind  with sweetness of manner  made the first and the last of the description .', ' that is the woman i want  said he .', ' something a little inferior i shall of course put up with  but it must not be much .', 'if i am a fool  i shall be a fool indeed  for i have thought on the subject more than most men .', 'chapter ', 'from this time captain wentworth and anne elliot were repeatedly in the same circle .', 'they were soon dining in company together at mr musgrove  s  for the little boy  s state could no longer supply his aunt with a pretence for absenting herself  and this was but the beginning of other dinings and other meetings .', 'whether former feelings were to be renewed must be brought to the proof  former times must undoubtedly be brought to the recollection of each  they could not but be reverted to  the year of their engagement could not but be named by him  in the little narratives or descriptions which conversation called forth .', 'his profession qualified him  his disposition lead him  to talk  and  that was in the year six   that happened before i went to sea in the year six  occurred in the course of the first evening they spent together  and though his voice did not falter  and though she had no reason to suppose his eye wandering towards her while he spoke  anne felt the utter impossibility  from her knowledge of his mind  that he could be unvisited by remembrance any more than herself .', 'there must be the same immediate association of thought  though she was very far from conceiving it to be of equal pain .', 'they had no conversation together  no intercourse but what the commonest civility required .', 'once so much to each other ', 'now nothing ', 'there had been a time  when of all the large party now filling the drawing  room at uppercross  they would have found it most difficult to cease to speak to one another .', 'with the exception  perhaps  of admiral and mrs croft  who seemed particularly attached and happy   anne could allow no other exceptions even among the married couples  there could have been no two hearts so open  no tastes so similar  no feelings so in unison  no countenances so beloved .', 'now they were as strangers  nay  worse than strangers  for they could never become acquainted .', 'it was a perpetual estrangement .', 'when he talked  she heard the same voice  and discerned the same mind .', 'there was a very general ignorance of all naval matters throughout the party  and he was very much questioned  and especially by the two miss musgroves  who seemed hardly to have any eyes but for him  as to the manner of living on board  daily regulations  food  hours   c . and their surprise at his accounts  at learning the degree of accommodation and arrangement which was practicable  drew from him some pleasant ridicule  which reminded anne of the early days when she too had been ignorant  and she too had been accused of supposing sailors to be living on board without anything to eat  or any cook to dress it if there were  or any servant to wait  or any knife and fork to use .', 'from thus listening and thinking  she was roused by a whisper of mrs musgrove  s who  overcome by fond regrets  could not help saying ', ' ah ', 'miss anne  if it had pleased heaven to spare my poor son  i dare say he would have been just such another by this time .', 'anne suppressed a smile  and listened kindly  while mrs musgrove relieved her heart a little more  and for a few minutes  therefore  could not keep pace with the conversation of the others .', 'when she could let her attention take its natural course again  she found the miss musgroves just fetching the navy list  their own navy list  the first that had ever been at uppercross  and sitting down together to pore over it  with the professed view of finding out the ships that captain wentworth had commanded .', ' your first was the asp  i remember  we will look for the asp .', ' you will not find her there .', 'quite worn out and broken up .', 'i was the last man who commanded her .', 'hardly fit for service then .', 'reported fit for home service for a year or two  and so i was sent off to the west indies .', 'the girls looked all amazement .', ' the admiralty  he continued   entertain themselves now and then  with sending a few hundred men to sea  in a ship not fit to be employed .', 'but they have a great many to provide for  and among the thousands that may just as well go to the bottom as not  it is impossible for them to distinguish the very set who may be least missed .', ' phoo ', 'phoo ', 'cried the admiral   what stuff these young fellows talk ', 'never was a better sloop than the asp in her day .', 'for an old built sloop  you would not see her equal .', 'lucky fellow to get her ', 'he knows there must have been twenty better men than himself applying for her at the same time .', 'lucky fellow to get anything so soon  with no more interest than his .', ' i felt my luck  admiral  i assure you  replied captain wentworth  seriously .', ' i was as well satisfied with my appointment as you can desire .', 'it was a great object with me at that time to be at sea  a very great object  i wanted to be doing something .', ' to be sure you did .', 'what should a young fellow like you do ashore for half a year together ', 'if a man had not a wife  he soon wants to be afloat again .', ' but  captain wentworth  cried louisa   how vexed you must have been when you came to the asp  to see what an old thing they had given you .', ' i knew pretty well what she was before that day  said he  smiling .', ' i had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to the fashion and strength of any old pelisse  which you had seen lent about among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember  and which at last  on some very wet day  is lent to yourself .', 'ah ', 'she was a dear old asp to me .', 'she did all that i wanted .', 'i knew she would .', 'i knew that we should either go to the bottom together  or that she would be the making of me  and i never had two days of foul weather all the time i was at sea in her  and after taking privateers enough to be very entertaining  i had the good luck in my passage home the next autumn  to fall in with the very french frigate i wanted .', 'i brought her into plymouth  and here another instance of luck .', 'we had not been six hours in the sound  when a gale came on  which lasted four days and nights  and which would have done for poor old asp in half the time  our touch with the great nation not having much improved our condition .', 'four  and  twenty hours later  and i should only have been a gallant captain wentworth  in a small paragraph at one corner of the newspapers  and being lost in only a sloop  nobody would have thought about me .', 'anne  s shudderings were to herself alone  but the miss musgroves could be as open as they were sincere  in their exclamations of pity and horror .', ' and so then  i suppose  said mrs musgrove  in a low voice  as if thinking aloud   so then he went away to the laconia  and there he met with our poor boy .', 'charles  my dear   beckoning him to her   do ask captain wentworth where it was he first met with your poor brother .', 'i always forgot .', ' it was at gibraltar  mother  i know .', 'dick had been left ill at gibraltar  with a recommendation from his former captain to captain wentworth .', ' oh ', 'but  charles  tell captain wentworth  he need not be afraid of mentioning poor dick before me  for it would be rather a pleasure to hear him talked of by such a good friend .', 'charles  being somewhat more mindful of the probabilities of the case  only nodded in reply  and walked away .', 'the girls were now hunting for the laconia  and captain wentworth could not deny himself the pleasure of taking the precious volume into his own hands to save them the trouble  and once more read aloud the little statement of her name and rate  and present non  commissioned class  observing over it that she too had been one of the best friends man ever had .', ' ah ', 'those were pleasant days when i had the laconia ', 'how fast i made money in her .', 'a friend of mine and i had such a lovely cruise together off the western islands .', 'poor harville  sister ', 'you know how much he wanted money  worse than myself .', 'he had a wife .', 'excellent fellow .', 'i shall never forget his happiness .', 'he felt it all  so much for her sake .', 'i wished for him again the next summer  when i had still the same luck in the mediterranean .', ' and i am sure  sir .', 'said mrs musgrove   it was a lucky day for us  when you were put captain into that ship .', 'we shall never forget what you did .', 'her feelings made her speak low  and captain wentworth  hearing only in part  and probably not having dick musgrove at all near his thoughts  looked rather in suspense  and as if waiting for more .', ' my brother  whispered one of the girls   mamma is thinking of poor richard .', ' poor dear fellow ', 'continued mrs musgrove   he was grown so steady  and such an excellent correspondent  while he was under your care ', 'ah ', 'it would have been a happy thing  if he had never left you .', 'i assure you  captain wentworth  we are very sorry he ever left you .', 'there was a momentary expression in captain wentworth  s face at this speech  a certain glance of his bright eye  and curl of his handsome mouth  which convinced anne  that instead of sharing in mrs musgrove  s kind wishes  as to her son  he had probably been at some pains to get rid of him  but it was too transient an indulgence of self  amusement to be detected by any who understood him less than herself  in another moment he was perfectly collected and serious  and almost instantly afterwards coming up to the sofa  on which she and mrs musgrove were sitting  took a place by the latter  and entered into conversation with her  in a low voice  about her son  doing it with so much sympathy and natural grace  as shewed the kindest consideration for all that was real and unabsurd in the parent  s feelings .', 'they were actually on the same sofa  for mrs musgrove had most readily made room for him  they were divided only by mrs musgrove .', 'it was no insignificant barrier  indeed .', 'mrs musgrove was of a comfortable  substantial size  infinitely more fitted by nature to express good cheer and good humour  than tenderness and sentiment  and while the agitations of anne  s slender form  and pensive face  may be considered as very completely screened  captain wentworth should be allowed some credit for the self  command with which he attended to her large fat sighings over the destiny of a son  whom alive nobody had cared for .', 'personal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportions .', 'a large bulky figure has as good a right to be in deep affliction  as the most graceful set of limbs in the world .', 'but  fair or not fair  there are unbecoming conjunctions  which reason will patronize in vain  which taste cannot tolerate  which ridicule will seize .', 'the admiral  after taking two or three refreshing turns about the room with his hands behind him  being called to order by his wife  now came up to captain wentworth  and without any observation of what he might be interrupting  thinking only of his own thoughts  began with ', ' if you had been a week later at lisbon  last spring  frederick  you would have been asked to give a passage to lady mary grierson and her daughters .', ' should i ', 'i am glad i was not a week later then .', 'the admiral abused him for his want of gallantry .', 'he defended himself  though professing that he would never willingly admit any ladies on board a ship of his  excepting for a ball  or a visit  which a few hours might comprehend .', ' but  if i know myself  said he   this is from no want of gallantry towards them .', 'it is rather from feeling how impossible it is  with all one  s efforts  and all one  s sacrifices  to make the accommodations on board such as women ought to have .', 'there can be no want of gallantry  admiral  in rating the claims of women to every personal comfort high  and this is what i do .', 'i hate to hear of women on board  or to see them on board  and no ship under my command shall ever convey a family of ladies anywhere  if i can help it .', 'this brought his sister upon him .', ' oh ', 'frederick ', 'but i cannot believe it of you .', ' all idle refinement ', ' women may be as comfortable on board  as in the best house in england .', 'i believe i have lived as much on board as most women  and i know nothing superior to the accommodations of a man  of  war .', 'i declare i have not a comfort or an indulgence about me  even at kellynch hall   with a kind bow to anne   beyond what i always had in most of the ships i have lived in  and they have been five altogether .', ' nothing to the purpose  replied her brother .', ' you were living with your husband  and were the only woman on board .', ' but you  yourself  brought mrs harville  her sister  her cousin  and three children  round from portsmouth to plymouth .', 'where was this superfine  extraordinary sort of gallantry of yours then ', ' all merged in my friendship  sophia .', 'i would assist any brother officer  s wife that i could  and i would bring anything of harville  s from the world  s end  if he wanted it .', 'but do not imagine that i did not feel it an evil in itself .', ' depend upon it  they were all perfectly comfortable .', ' i might not like them the better for that perhaps .', 'such a number of women and children have no right to be comfortable on board .', ' my dear frederick  you are talking quite idly .', 'pray  what would become of us poor sailors  wives  who often want to be conveyed to one port or another  after our husbands  if everybody had your feelings ', ' my feelings  you see  did not prevent my taking mrs harville and all her family to plymouth .', ' but i hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman  and as if women were all fine ladies  instead of rational creatures .', 'we none of us expect to be in smooth water all our days .', ' ah ', 'my dear  said the admiral   when he had got a wife  he will sing a different tune .', 'when he is married  if we have the good luck to live to another war  we shall see him do as you and i  and a great many others  have done .', 'we shall have him very thankful to anybody that will bring him his wife .', ' ay  that we shall .', ' now i have done  cried captain wentworth .', ' when once married people begin to attack me with  oh ', 'you will think very differently  when you are married .', 'i can only say   no  i shall not  and then they say again   yes  you will  and there is an end of it .', 'he got up and moved away .', ' what a great traveller you must have been  ma  am ', 'said mrs musgrove to mrs croft .', ' pretty well  ma  am in the fifteen years of my marriage  though many women have done more .', 'i have crossed the atlantic four times  and have been once to the east indies  and back again  and only once  besides being in different places about home  cork  and lisbon  and gibraltar .', 'but i never went beyond the streights  and never was in the west indies .', 'we do not call bermuda or bahama  you know  the west indies .', 'mrs musgrove had not a word to say in dissent  she could not accuse herself of having ever called them anything in the whole course of her life .', ' and i do assure you  ma  am  pursued mrs croft   that nothing can exceed the accommodations of a man  of  war  i speak  you know  of the higher rates .', 'when you come to a frigate  of course  you are more confined  though any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one of them  and i can safely say  that the happiest part of my life has been spent on board a ship .', 'while we were together  you know  there was nothing to be feared .', 'thank god ', 'i have always been blessed with excellent health  and no climate disagrees with me .', 'a little disordered always the first twenty  four hours of going to sea  but never knew what sickness was afterwards .', 'the only time i ever really suffered in body or mind  the only time that i ever fancied myself unwell  or had any ideas of danger  was the winter that i passed by myself at deal  when the admiral  captain croft then  was in the north seas .', 'i lived in perpetual fright at that time  and had all manner of imaginary complaints from not knowing what to do with myself  or when i should hear from him next  but as long as we could be together  nothing ever ailed me  and i never met with the smallest inconvenience .', ' aye  to be sure .', 'yes  indeed  oh yes ', 'i am quite of your opinion  mrs croft  was mrs musgrove  s hearty answer .', ' there is nothing so bad as a separation .', 'i am quite of your opinion .', 'i know what it is  for mr musgrove always attends the assizes  and i am so glad when they are over  and he is safe back again .', 'the evening ended with dancing .', 'on its being proposed  anne offered her services  as usual  and though her eyes would sometimes fill with tears as she sat at the instrument  she was extremely glad to be employed  and desired nothing in return but to be unobserved .', 'it was a merry  joyous party  and no one seemed in higher spirits than captain wentworth .', 'she felt that he had every thing to elevate him which general attention and deference  and especially the attention of all the young women  could do .', 'the miss hayters  the females of the family of cousins already mentioned  were apparently admitted to the honour of being in love with him  and as for henrietta and louisa  they both seemed so entirely occupied by him  that nothing but the continued appearance of the most perfect good  will between themselves could have made it credible that they were not decided rivals .', 'if he were a little spoilt by such universal  such eager admiration  who could wonder ', 'these were some of the thoughts which occupied anne  while her fingers were mechanically at work  proceeding for half an hour together  equally without error  and without consciousness .', 'once she felt that he was looking at herself  observing her altered features  perhaps  trying to trace in them the ruins of the face which had once charmed him  and once she knew that he must have spoken of her  she was hardly aware of it  till she heard the answer  but then she was sure of his having asked his partner whether miss elliot never danced ', 'the answer was   oh  no  never  she has quite given up dancing .', 'she had rather play .', 'she is never tired of playing .', 'once  too  he spoke to her .', 'she had left the instrument on the dancing being over  and he had sat down to try to make out an air which he wished to give the miss musgroves an idea of .', 'unintentionally she returned to that part of the room  he saw her  and  instantly rising  said  with studied politeness ', ' i beg your pardon  madam  this is your seat  and though she immediately drew back with a decided negative  he was not to be induced to sit down again .', 'anne did not wish for more of such looks and speeches .', 'his cold politeness  his ceremonious grace  were worse than anything .', 'chapter ', 'captain wentworth was come to kellynch as to a home  to stay as long as he liked  being as thoroughly the object of the admiral  s fraternal kindness as of his wife  s .', 'he had intended  on first arriving  to proceed very soon into shropshire  and visit the brother settled in that country  but the attractions of uppercross induced him to put this off .', 'there was so much of friendliness  and of flattery  and of everything most bewitching in his reception there  the old were so hospitable  the young so agreeable  that he could not but resolve to remain where he was  and take all the charms and perfections of edward  s wife upon credit a little longer .', 'it was soon uppercross with him almost every day .', 'the musgroves could hardly be more ready to invite than he to come  particularly in the morning  when he had no companion at home  for the admiral and mrs croft were generally out of doors together  interesting themselves in their new possessions  their grass  and their sheep  and dawdling about in a way not endurable to a third person  or driving out in a gig  lately added to their establishment .', 'hitherto there had been but one opinion of captain wentworth among the musgroves and their dependencies .', 'it was unvarying  warm admiration everywhere  but this intimate footing was not more than established  when a certain charles hayter returned among them  to be a good deal disturbed by it  and to think captain wentworth very much in the way .', 'charles hayter was the eldest of all the cousins  and a very amiable  pleasing young man  between whom and henrietta there had been a considerable appearance of attachment previous to captain wentworth  s introduction .', 'he was in orders  and having a curacy in the neighbourhood  where residence was not required  lived at his father  s house  only two miles from uppercross .', 'a short absence from home had left his fair one unguarded by his attentions at this critical period  and when he came back he had the pain of finding very altered manners  and of seeing captain wentworth .', 'mrs musgrove and mrs hayter were sisters .', 'they had each had money  but their marriages had made a material difference in their degree of consequence .', 'mr hayter had some property of his own  but it was insignificant compared with mr musgrove  s  and while the musgroves were in the first class of society in the country  the young hayters would  from their parents  inferior  retired  and unpolished way of living  and their own defective education  have been hardly in any class at all  but for their connexion with uppercross  this eldest son of course excepted  who had chosen to be a scholar and a gentleman  and who was very superior in cultivation and manners to all the rest .', 'the two families had always been on excellent terms  there being no pride on one side  and no envy on the other  and only such a consciousness of superiority in the miss musgroves  as made them pleased to improve their cousins .', 'charles  s attentions to henrietta had been observed by her father and mother without any disapprobation .', ' it would not be a great match for her  but if henrietta liked him  and henrietta did seem to like him .', 'henrietta fully thought so herself  before captain wentworth came  but from that time cousin charles had been very much forgotten .', 'which of the two sisters was preferred by captain wentworth was as yet quite doubtful  as far as anne  s observation reached .', 'henrietta was perhaps the prettiest  louisa had the higher spirits  and she knew not now  whether the more gentle or the more lively character were most likely to attract him .', 'mr and mrs musgrove  either from seeing little  or from an entire confidence in the discretion of both their daughters  and of all the young men who came near them  seemed to leave everything to take its chance .', 'there was not the smallest appearance of solicitude or remark about them in the mansion  house  but it was different at the cottage  the young couple there were more disposed to speculate and wonder  and captain wentworth had not been above four or five times in the miss musgroves  company  and charles hayter had but just reappeared  when anne had to listen to the opinions of her brother and sister  as to which was the one liked best .', 'charles gave it for louisa  mary for henrietta  but quite agreeing that to have him marry either could be extremely delightful .', 'charles  had never seen a pleasanter man in his life  and from what he had once heard captain wentworth himself say  was very sure that he had not made less than twenty thousand pounds by the war .', 'here was a fortune at once  besides which  there would be the chance of what might be done in any future war  and he was sure captain wentworth was as likely a man to distinguish himself as any officer in the navy .', 'oh ', 'it would be a capital match for either of his sisters .', ' upon my word it would  replied mary .', ' dear me ', 'if he should rise to any very great honours ', 'if he should ever be made a baronet ', ' lady wentworth  sounds very well .', 'that would be a noble thing  indeed  for henrietta ', 'she would take place of me then  and henrietta would not dislike that .', 'sir frederick and lady wentworth ', 'it would be but a new creation  however  and i never think much of your new creations .', 'it suited mary best to think henrietta the one preferred on the very account of charles hayter  whose pretensions she wished to see put an end to .', 'she looked down very decidedly upon the hayters  and thought it would be quite a misfortune to have the existing connection between the families renewed  very sad for herself and her children .', ' you know  said she   i cannot think him at all a fit match for henrietta  and considering the alliances which the musgroves have made  she has no right to throw herself away .', 'i do not think any young woman has a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenient to the principal part of her family  and be giving bad connections to those who have not been used to them .', 'and  pray  who is charles hayter ', 'nothing but a country curate .', 'a most improper match for miss musgrove of uppercross .', 'her husband  however  would not agree with her here  for besides having a regard for his cousin  charles hayter was an eldest son  and he saw things as an eldest son himself .', ' now you are taking nonsense  mary  was therefore his answer .', ' it would not be a great match for henrietta  but charles has a very fair chance  through the spicers  of getting something from the bishop in the course of a year or two  and you will please to remember  that he is the eldest son  whenever my uncle dies  he steps into very pretty property .', 'the estate at winthrop is not less than two hundred and fifty acres  besides the farm near taunton  which is some of the best land in the country .', 'i grant you  that any of them but charles would be a very shocking match for henrietta  and indeed it could not be  he is the only one that could be possible  but he is a very good  natured  good sort of a fellow  and whenever winthrop comes into his hands  he will make a different sort of place of it  and live in a very different sort of way  and with that property  he will never be a contemptible man  good  freehold property .', 'no  no  henrietta might do worse than marry charles hayter  and if she has him  and louisa can get captain wentworth  i shall be very well satisfied .', ' charles may say what he pleases  cried mary to anne  as soon as he was out of the room   but it would be shocking to have henrietta marry charles hayter  a very bad thing for her  and still worse for me  and therefore it is very much to be wished that captain wentworth may soon put him quite out of her head  and i have very little doubt that he has .', 'she took hardly any notice of charles hayter yesterday .', 'i wish you had been there to see her behaviour .', 'and as to captain wentworth  s liking louisa as well as henrietta  it is nonsense to say so  for he certainly does like henrietta a great deal the best .', 'but charles is so positive ', 'i wish you had been with us yesterday  for then you might have decided between us  and i am sure you would have thought as i did  unless you had been determined to give it against me .', 'a dinner at mr musgrove  s had been the occasion when all these things should have been seen by anne  but she had staid at home  under the mixed plea of a headache of her own  and some return of indisposition in little charles .', 'she had thought only of avoiding captain wentworth  but an escape from being appealed to as umpire was now added to the advantages of a quiet evening .', 'as to captain wentworth  s views  she deemed it of more consequence that he should know his own mind early enough not to be endangering the happiness of either sister  or impeaching his own honour  than that he should prefer henrietta to louisa  or louisa to henrietta .', 'either of them would  in all probability  make him an affectionate  good  humoured wife .', 'with regard to charles hayter  she had delicacy which must be pained by any lightness of conduct in a well  meaning young woman  and a heart to sympathize in any of the sufferings it occasioned  but if henrietta found herself mistaken in the nature of her feelings  the alternation could not be understood too soon .', 'charles hayter had met with much to disquiet and mortify him in his cousin  s behaviour .', 'she had too old a regard for him to be so wholly estranged as might in two meetings extinguish every past hope  and leave him nothing to do but to keep away from uppercross  but there was such a change as became very alarming  when such a man as captain wentworth was to be regarded as the probable cause .', 'he had been absent only two sundays  and when they parted  had left her interested  even to the height of his wishes  in his prospect of soon quitting his present curacy  and obtaining that of uppercross instead .', 'it had then seemed the object nearest her heart  that dr shirley  the rector  who for more than forty years had been zealously discharging all the duties of his office  but was now growing too infirm for many of them  should be quite fixed on engaging a curate  should make his curacy quite as good as he could afford  and should give charles hayter the promise of it .', 'the advantage of his having to come only to uppercross  instead of going six miles another way  of his having  in every respect  a better curacy  of his belonging to their dear dr shirley  and of dear  good dr shirley  s being relieved from the duty which he could no longer get through without most injurious fatigue  had been a great deal  even to louisa  but had been almost everything to henrietta .', 'when he came back  alas ', 'the zeal of the business was gone by .', 'louisa could not listen at all to his account of a conversation which he had just held with dr shirley  she was at a window  looking out for captain wentworth  and even henrietta had at best only a divided attention to give  and seemed to have forgotten all the former doubt and solicitude of the negotiation .', ' well  i am very glad indeed  but i always thought you would have it  i always thought you sure .', 'it did not appear to me that  in short  you know  dr shirley must have a curate  and you had secured his promise .', 'is he coming  louisa ', 'one morning  very soon after the dinner at the musgroves  at which anne had not been present  captain wentworth walked into the drawing  room at the cottage  where were only herself and the little invalid charles  who was lying on the sofa .', 'the surprise of finding himself almost alone with anne elliot  deprived his manners of their usual composure  he started  and could only say   i thought the miss musgroves had been here  mrs musgrove told me i should find them here  before he walked to the window to recollect himself  and feel how he ought to behave .', ' they are up stairs with my sister  they will be down in a few moments  i dare say  had been anne  s reply  in all the confusion that was natural  and if the child had not called her to come and do something for him  she would have been out of the room the next moment  and released captain wentworth as well as herself .', 'he continued at the window  and after calmly and politely saying   i hope the little boy is better  was silent .', 'she was obliged to kneel down by the sofa  and remain there to satisfy her patient  and thus they continued a few minutes  when  to her very great satisfaction  she heard some other person crossing the little vestibule .', 'she hoped  on turning her head  to see the master of the house  but it proved to be one much less calculated for making matters easy  charles hayter  probably not at all better pleased by the sight of captain wentworth than captain wentworth had been by the sight of anne .', 'she only attempted to say   how do you do ', 'will you not sit down ', 'the others will be here presently .', 'captain wentworth  however  came from his window  apparently not ill  disposed for conversation  but charles hayter soon put an end to his attempts by seating himself near the table  and taking up the newspaper  and captain wentworth returned to his window .', 'another minute brought another addition .', 'the younger boy  a remarkable stout  forward child  of two years old  having got the door opened for him by some one without  made his determined appearance among them  and went straight to the sofa to see what was going on  and put in his claim to anything good that might be giving away .', 'there being nothing to eat  he could only have some play  and as his aunt would not let him tease his sick brother  he began to fasten himself upon her  as she knelt  in such a way that  busy as she was about charles  she could not shake him off .', 'she spoke to him  ordered  entreated  and insisted in vain .', 'once she did contrive to push him away  but the boy had the greater pleasure in getting upon her back again directly .', ' walter  said she   get down this moment .', 'you are extremely troublesome .', 'i am very angry with you .', ' walter  cried charles hayter   why do you not do as you are bid ', 'do not you hear your aunt speak ', 'come to me  walter  come to cousin charles .', 'but not a bit did walter stir .', 'in another moment  however  she found herself in the state of being released from him  some one was taking him from her  though he had bent down her head so much  that his little sturdy hands were unfastened from around her neck  and he was resolutely borne away  before she knew that captain wentworth had done it .', 'her sensations on the discovery made her perfectly speechless .', 'she could not even thank him .', 'she could only hang over little charles  with most disordered feelings .', 'his kindness in stepping forward to her relief  the manner  the silence in which it had passed  the little particulars of the circumstance  with the conviction soon forced on her by the noise he was studiously making with the child  that he meant to avoid hearing her thanks  and rather sought to testify that her conversation was the last of his wants  produced such a confusion of varying  but very painful agitation  as she could not recover from  till enabled by the entrance of mary and the miss musgroves to make over her little patient to their cares  and leave the room .', 'she could not stay .', 'it might have been an opportunity of watching the loves and jealousies of the four  they were now altogether  but she could stay for none of it .', 'it was evident that charles hayter was not well inclined towards captain wentworth .', 'she had a strong impression of his having said  in a vext tone of voice  after captain wentworth  s interference   you ought to have minded me  walter  i told you not to teaze your aunt  and could comprehend his regretting that captain wentworth should do what he ought to have done himself .', 'but neither charles hayter  s feelings  nor anybody  s feelings  could interest her  till she had a little better arranged her own .', 'she was ashamed of herself  quite ashamed of being so nervous  so overcome by such a trifle  but so it was  and it required a long application of solitude and reflection to recover her .', 'chapter ', 'other opportunities of making her observations could not fail to occur .', 'anne had soon been in company with all the four together often enough to have an opinion  though too wise to acknowledge as much at home  where she knew it would have satisfied neither husband nor wife  for while she considered louisa to be rather the favourite  she could not but think  as far as she might dare to judge from memory and experience  that captain wentworth was not in love with either .', 'they were more in love with him  yet there it was not love .', 'it was a little fever of admiration  but it might  probably must  end in love with some .', 'charles hayter seemed aware of being slighted  and yet henrietta had sometimes the air of being divided between them .', 'anne longed for the power of representing to them all what they were about  and of pointing out some of the evils they were exposing themselves to .', 'she did not attribute guile to any .', 'it was the highest satisfaction to her to believe captain wentworth not in the least aware of the pain he was occasioning .', 'there was no triumph  no pitiful triumph in his manner .', 'he had  probably  never heard  and never thought of any claims of charles hayter .', 'he was only wrong in accepting the attentions  for accepting must be the word  of two young women at once .', 'after a short struggle  however  charles hayter seemed to quit the field .', 'three days had passed without his coming once to uppercross  a most decided change .', 'he had even refused one regular invitation to dinner  and having been found on the occasion by mr musgrove with some large books before him  mr and mrs musgrove were sure all could not be right  and talked  with grave faces  of his studying himself to death .', 'it was mary  s hope and belief that he had received a positive dismissal from henrietta  and her husband lived under the constant dependence of seeing him to  morrow .', 'anne could only feel that charles hayter was wise .', 'one morning  about this time charles musgrove and captain wentworth being gone a  shooting together  as the sisters in the cottage were sitting quietly at work  they were visited at the window by the sisters from the mansion  house .', 'it was a very fine november day  and the miss musgroves came through the little grounds  and stopped for no other purpose than to say  that they were going to take a long walk  and therefore concluded mary could not like to go with them  and when mary immediately replied  with some jealousy at not being supposed a good walker   oh  yes  i should like to join you very much  i am very fond of a long walk  anne felt persuaded  by the looks of the two girls  that it was precisely what they did not wish  and admired again the sort of necessity which the family habits seemed to produce  of everything being to be communicated  and everything being to be done together  however undesired and inconvenient .', 'she tried to dissuade mary from going  but in vain  and that being the case  thought it best to accept the miss musgroves  much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise  as she might be useful in turning back with her sister  and lessening the interference in any plan of their own .', ' i cannot imagine why they should suppose i should not like a long walk  said mary  as she went up stairs .', ' everybody is always supposing that i am not a good walker  and yet they would not have been pleased  if we had refused to join them .', 'when people come in this manner on purpose to ask us  how can one say no ', 'just as they were setting off  the gentlemen returned .', 'they had taken out a young dog  who had spoilt their sport  and sent them back early .', 'their time and strength  and spirits  were  therefore  exactly ready for this walk  and they entered into it with pleasure .', 'could anne have foreseen such a junction  she would have staid at home  but  from some feelings of interest and curiosity  she fancied now that it was too late to retract  and the whole six set forward together in the direction chosen by the miss musgroves  who evidently considered the walk as under their guidance .', 'anne  s object was  not to be in the way of anybody  and where the narrow paths across the fields made many separations necessary  to keep with her brother and sister .', 'her pleasure in the walk must arise from the exercise and the day  from the view of the last smiles of the year upon the tawny leaves  and withered hedges  and from repeating to herself some few of the thousand poetical descriptions extant of autumn  that season of peculiar and inexhaustible influence on the mind of taste and tenderness  that season which had drawn from every poet  worthy of being read  some attempt at description  or some lines of feeling .', 'she occupied her mind as much as possible in such like musings and quotations  but it was not possible  that when within reach of captain wentworth  s conversation with either of the miss musgroves  she should not try to hear it  yet she caught little very remarkable .', 'it was mere lively chat  such as any young persons  on an intimate footing  might fall into .', 'he was more engaged with louisa than with henrietta .', 'louisa certainly put more forward for his notice than her sister .', 'this distinction appeared to increase  and there was one speech of louisa  s which struck her .', 'after one of the many praises of the day  which were continually bursting forth  captain wentworth added  ', ' what glorious weather for the admiral and my sister ', 'they meant to take a long drive this morning  perhaps we may hail them from some of these hills .', 'they talked of coming into this side of the country .', 'i wonder whereabouts they will upset to  day .', 'oh ', 'it does happen very often  i assure you  but my sister makes nothing of it  she would as lieve be tossed out as not .', ' ah ', 'you make the most of it  i know  cried louisa   but if it were really so  i should do just the same in her place .', 'if i loved a man  as she loves the admiral  i would always be with him  nothing should ever separate us  and i would rather be overturned by him  than driven safely by anybody else .', 'it was spoken with enthusiasm .', ' had you ', 'cried he  catching the same tone   i honour you ', 'and there was silence between them for a little while .', 'anne could not immediately fall into a quotation again .', 'the sweet scenes of autumn were for a while put by  unless some tender sonnet  fraught with the apt analogy of the declining year  with declining happiness  and the images of youth and hope  and spring  all gone together  blessed her memory .', 'she roused herself to say  as they struck by order into another path   is not this one of the ways to winthrop ', 'but nobody heard  or  at least  nobody answered her .', 'winthrop  however  or its environs  for young men are  sometimes to be met with  strolling about near home  was their destination  and after another half mile of gradual ascent through large enclosures  where the ploughs at work  and the fresh made path spoke the farmer counteracting the sweets of poetical despondence  and meaning to have spring again  they gained the summit of the most considerable hill  which parted uppercross and winthrop  and soon commanded a full view of the latter  at the foot of the hill on the other side .', 'winthrop  without beauty and without dignity  was stretched before them an indifferent house  standing low  and hemmed in by the barns and buildings of a farm  yard .', 'mary exclaimed   bless me ', 'here is winthrop .', 'i declare i had no idea ', 'well now  i think we had better turn back  i am excessively tired .', 'henrietta  conscious and ashamed  and seeing no cousin charles walking along any path  or leaning against any gate  was ready to do as mary wished  but  no ', 'said charles musgrove  and  no  no ', 'cried louisa more eagerly  and taking her sister aside  seemed to be arguing the matter warmly .', 'charles  in the meanwhile  was very decidedly declaring his resolution of calling on his aunt  now that he was so near  and very evidently  though more fearfully  trying to induce his wife to go too .', 'but this was one of the points on which the lady shewed her strength  and when he recommended the advantage of resting herself a quarter of an hour at winthrop  as she felt so tired  she resolutely answered   oh ', 'no  indeed ', 'walking up that hill again would do her more harm than any sitting down could do her good  and  in short  her look and manner declared  that go she would not .', 'after a little succession of these sort of debates and consultations  it was settled between charles and his two sisters  that he and henrietta should just run down for a few minutes  to see their aunt and cousins  while the rest of the party waited for them at the top of the hill .', 'louisa seemed the principal arranger of the plan  and  as she went a little way with them  down the hill  still talking to henrietta  mary took the opportunity of looking scornfully around her  and saying to captain wentworth ', ' it is very unpleasant  having such connexions ', 'but  i assure you  i have never been in the house above twice in my life .', 'she received no other answer  than an artificial  assenting smile  followed by a contemptuous glance  as he turned away  which anne perfectly knew the meaning of .', 'the brow of the hill  where they remained  was a cheerful spot  louisa returned  and mary  finding a comfortable seat for herself on the step of a stile  was very well satisfied so long as the others all stood about her  but when louisa drew captain wentworth away  to try for a gleaning of nuts in an adjoining hedge  row  and they were gone by degrees quite out of sight and sound  mary was happy no longer  she quarrelled with her own seat  was sure louisa had got a much better somewhere  and nothing could prevent her from going to look for a better also .', 'she turned through the same gate  but could not see them .', 'anne found a nice seat for her  on a dry sunny bank  under the hedge  row  in which she had no doubt of their still being  in some spot or other .', 'mary sat down for a moment  but it would not do  she was sure louisa had found a better seat somewhere else  and she would go on till she overtook her .', 'anne  really tired herself  was glad to sit down  and she very soon heard captain wentworth and louisa in the hedge  row  behind her  as if making their way back along the rough  wild sort of channel  down the centre .', 'they were speaking as they drew near .', 'louisa  s voice was the first distinguished .', 'she seemed to be in the middle of some eager speech .', 'what anne first heard was ', ' and so  i made her go .', 'i could not bear that she should be frightened from the visit by such nonsense .', 'what ', 'would i be turned back from doing a thing that i had determined to do  and that i knew to be right  by the airs and interference of such a person  or of any person i may say ', 'no  i have no idea of being so easily persuaded .', 'when i have made up my mind  i have made it  and henrietta seemed entirely to have made up hers to call at winthrop to  day  and yet  she was as near giving it up  out of nonsensical complaisance ', ' she would have turned back then  but for you ', ' she would indeed .', 'i am almost ashamed to say it .', ' happy for her  to have such a mind as yours at hand ', 'after the hints you gave just now  which did but confirm my own observations  the last time i was in company with him  i need not affect to have no comprehension of what is going on .', 'i see that more than a mere dutiful morning visit to your aunt was in question  and woe betide him  and her too  when it comes to things of consequence  when they are placed in circumstances requiring fortitude and strength of mind  if she have not resolution enough to resist idle interference in such a trifle as this .', 'your sister is an amiable creature  but yours is the character of decision and firmness  i see .', 'if you value her conduct or happiness  infuse as much of your own spirit into her as you can .', 'but this  no doubt  you have been always doing .', 'it is the worst evil of too yielding and indecisive a character  that no influence over it can be depended on .', 'you are never sure of a good impression being durable  everybody may sway it .', 'let those who would be happy be firm .', 'here is a nut  said he  catching one down from an upper bough .', ' to exemplify  a beautiful glossy nut  which  blessed with original strength  has outlived all the storms of autumn .', 'not a puncture  not a weak spot anywhere .', 'this nut  he continued  with playful solemnity   while so many of his brethren have fallen and been trodden under foot  is still in possession of all the happiness that a hazel nut can be supposed capable of .', 'then returning to his former earnest tone   my first wish for all whom i am interested in  is that they should be firm .', 'if louisa musgrove would be beautiful and happy in her november of life  she will cherish all her present powers of mind .', 'he had done  and was unanswered .', 'it would have surprised anne if louisa could have readily answered such a speech  words of such interest  spoken with such serious warmth ', 'she could imagine what louisa was feeling .', 'for herself  she feared to move  lest she should be seen .', 'while she remained  a bush of low rambling holly protected her  and they were moving on .', 'before they were beyond her hearing  however  louisa spoke again .', ' mary is good  natured enough in many respects  said she   but she does sometimes provoke me excessively  by her nonsense and pride  the elliot pride .', 'she has a great deal too much of the elliot pride .', 'we do so wish that charles had married anne instead .', 'i suppose you know he wanted to marry anne ', 'after a moment  s pause  captain wentworth said ', ' do you mean that she refused him ', ' oh ', 'yes  certainly .', ' when did that happen ', ' i do not exactly know  for henrietta and i were at school at the time  but i believe about a year before he married mary .', 'i wish she had accepted him .', 'we should all have liked her a great deal better  and papa and mamma always think it was her great friend lady russell  s doing  that she did not .', 'they think charles might not be learned and bookish enough to please lady russell  and that therefore  she persuaded anne to refuse him .', 'the sounds were retreating  and anne distinguished no more .', 'her own emotions still kept her fixed .', 'she had much to recover from  before she could move .', 'the listener  s proverbial fate was not absolutely hers  she had heard no evil of herself  but she had heard a great deal of very painful import .', 'she saw how her own character was considered by captain wentworth  and there had been just that degree of feeling and curiosity about her in his manner which must give her extreme agitation .', 'as soon as she could  she went after mary  and having found  and walked back with her to their former station  by the stile  felt some comfort in their whole party being immediately afterwards collected  and once more in motion together .', 'her spirits wanted the solitude and silence which only numbers could give .', 'charles and henrietta returned  bringing  as may be conjectured  charles hayter with them .', 'the minutiae of the business anne could not attempt to understand  even captain wentworth did not seem admitted to perfect confidence here  but that there had been a withdrawing on the gentleman  s side  and a relenting on the lady  s  and that they were now very glad to be together again  did not admit a doubt .', 'henrietta looked a little ashamed  but very well pleased  charles hayter exceedingly happy  and they were devoted to each other almost from the first instant of their all setting forward for uppercross .', 'everything now marked out louisa for captain wentworth  nothing could be plainer  and where many divisions were necessary  or even where they were not  they walked side by side nearly as much as the other two .', 'in a long strip of meadow land  where there was ample space for all  they were thus divided  forming three distinct parties  and to that party of the three which boasted least animation  and least complaisance  anne necessarily belonged .', 'she joined charles and mary  and was tired enough to be very glad of charles  s other arm  but charles  though in very good humour with her  was out of temper with his wife .', 'mary had shewn herself disobliging to him  and was now to reap the consequence  which consequence was his dropping her arm almost every moment to cut off the heads of some nettles in the hedge with his switch  and when mary began to complain of it  and lament her being ill  used  according to custom  in being on the hedge side  while anne was never incommoded on the other  he dropped the arms of both to hunt after a weasel which he had a momentary glance of  and they could hardly get him along at all .', 'this long meadow bordered a lane  which their footpath  at the end of it was to cross  and when the party had all reached the gate of exit  the carriage advancing in the same direction  which had been some time heard  was just coming up  and proved to be admiral croft  s gig .', 'he and his wife had taken their intended drive  and were returning home .', 'upon hearing how long a walk the young people had engaged in  they kindly offered a seat to any lady who might be particularly tired  it would save her a full mile  and they were going through uppercross .', 'the invitation was general  and generally declined .', 'the miss musgroves were not at all tired  and mary was either offended  by not being asked before any of the others  or what louisa called the elliot pride could not endure to make a third in a one horse chaise .', 'the walking party had crossed the lane  and were surmounting an opposite stile  and the admiral was putting his horse in motion again  when captain wentworth cleared the hedge in a moment to say something to his sister .', 'the something might be guessed by its effects .', ' miss elliot  i am sure you are tired  cried mrs croft .', ' do let us have the pleasure of taking you home .', 'here is excellent room for three  i assure you .', 'if we were all like you  i believe we might sit four .', 'you must  indeed  you must .', 'anne was still in the lane  and though instinctively beginning to decline  she was not allowed to proceed .', 'the admiral  s kind urgency came in support of his wife  s  they would not be refused  they compressed themselves into the smallest possible space to leave her a corner  and captain wentworth  without saying a word  turned to her  and quietly obliged her to be assisted into the carriage .', 'yes  he had done it .', 'she was in the carriage  and felt that he had placed her there  that his will and his hands had done it  that she owed it to his perception of her fatigue  and his resolution to give her rest .', 'she was very much affected by the view of his disposition towards her  which all these things made apparent .', 'this little circumstance seemed the completion of all that had gone before .', 'she understood him .', 'he could not forgive her  but he could not be unfeeling .', 'though condemning her for the past  and considering it with high and unjust resentment  though perfectly careless of her  and though becoming attached to another  still he could not see her suffer  without the desire of giving her relief .', 'it was a remainder of former sentiment  it was an impulse of pure  though unacknowledged friendship  it was a proof of his own warm and amiable heart  which she could not contemplate without emotions so compounded of pleasure and pain  that she knew not which prevailed .', 'her answers to the kindness and the remarks of her companions were at first unconsciously given .', 'they had travelled half their way along the rough lane  before she was quite awake to what they said .', 'she then found them talking of  frederick .', ' he certainly means to have one or other of those two girls  sophy  said the admiral   but there is no saying which .', 'he has been running after them  too  long enough  one would think  to make up his mind .', 'ay  this comes of the peace .', 'if it were war now  he would have settled it long ago .', 'we sailors  miss elliot  cannot afford to make long courtships in time of war .', 'how many days was it  my dear  between the first time of my seeing you and our sitting down together in our lodgings at north yarmouth ', ' we had better not talk about it  my dear  replied mrs croft  pleasantly   for if miss elliot were to hear how soon we came to an understanding  she would never be persuaded that we could be happy together .', 'i had known you by character  however  long before .', ' well  and i had heard of you as a very pretty girl  and what were we to wait for besides ', 'i do not like having such things so long in hand .', 'i wish frederick would spread a little more canvass  and bring us home one of these young ladies to kellynch .', 'then there would always be company for them .', 'and very nice young ladies they both are  i hardly know one from the other .', ' very good humoured  unaffected girls  indeed  said mrs croft  in a tone of calmer praise  such as made anne suspect that her keener powers might not consider either of them as quite worthy of her brother   and a very respectable family .', 'one could not be connected with better people .', 'my dear admiral  that post ', 'we shall certainly take that post .', 'but by coolly giving the reins a better direction herself they happily passed the danger  and by once afterwards judiciously putting out her hand they neither fell into a rut  nor ran foul of a dung  cart  and anne  with some amusement at their style of driving  which she imagined no bad representation of the general guidance of their affairs  found herself safely deposited by them at the cottage .', 'chapter ', 'the time now approached for lady russell  s return  the day was even fixed  and anne  being engaged to join her as soon as she was resettled  was looking forward to an early removal to kellynch  and beginning to think how her own comfort was likely to be affected by it .', 'it would place her in the same village with captain wentworth  within half a mile of him  they would have to frequent the same church  and there must be intercourse between the two families .', 'this was against her  but on the other hand  he spent so much of his time at uppercross  that in removing thence she might be considered rather as leaving him behind  than as going towards him  and  upon the whole  she believed she must  on this interesting question  be the gainer  almost as certainly as in her change of domestic society  in leaving poor mary for lady russell .', 'she wished it might be possible for her to avoid ever seeing captain wentworth at the hall  those rooms had witnessed former meetings which would be brought too painfully before her  but she was yet more anxious for the possibility of lady russell and captain wentworth never meeting anywhere .', 'they did not like each other  and no renewal of acquaintance now could do any good  and were lady russell to see them together  she might think that he had too much self  possession  and she too little .', 'these points formed her chief solicitude in anticipating her removal from uppercross  where she felt she had been stationed quite long enough .', 'her usefulness to little charles would always give some sweetness to the memory of her two months  visit there  but he was gaining strength apace  and she had nothing else to stay for .', 'the conclusion of her visit  however  was diversified in a way which she had not at all imagined .', 'captain wentworth  after being unseen and unheard of at uppercross for two whole days  appeared again among them to justify himself by a relation of what had kept him away .', 'a letter from his friend  captain harville  having found him out at last  had brought intelligence of captain harville  s being settled with his family at lyme for the winter  of their being therefore  quite unknowingly  within twenty miles of each other .', 'captain harville had never been in good health since a severe wound which he received two years before  and captain wentworth  s anxiety to see him had determined him to go immediately to lyme .', 'he had been there for four  and  twenty hours .', 'his acquittal was complete  his friendship warmly honoured  a lively interest excited for his friend  and his description of the fine country about lyme so feelingly attended to by the party  that an earnest desire to see lyme themselves  and a project for going thither was the consequence .', 'the young people were all wild to see lyme .', 'captain wentworth talked of going there again himself  it was only seventeen miles from uppercross  though november  the weather was by no means bad  and  in short  louisa  who was the most eager of the eager  having formed the resolution to go  and besides the pleasure of doing as she liked  being now armed with the idea of merit in maintaining her own way  bore down all the wishes of her father and mother for putting it off till summer  and to lyme they were to go  charles  mary  anne  henrietta  louisa  and captain wentworth .', 'the first heedless scheme had been to go in the morning and return at night  but to this mr musgrove  for the sake of his horses  would not consent  and when it came to be rationally considered  a day in the middle of november would not leave much time for seeing a new place  after deducting seven hours  as the nature of the country required  for going and returning .', 'they were  consequently  to stay the night there  and not to be expected back till the next day  s dinner .', 'this was felt to be a considerable amendment  and though they all met at the great house at rather an early breakfast hour  and set off very punctually  it was so much past noon before the two carriages  mr musgrove  s coach containing the four ladies  and charles  s curricle  in which he drove captain wentworth  were descending the long hill into lyme  and entering upon the still steeper street of the town itself  that it was very evident they would not have more than time for looking about them  before the light and warmth of the day were gone .', 'after securing accommodations  and ordering a dinner at one of the inns  the next thing to be done was unquestionably to walk directly down to the sea .', 'they were come too late in the year for any amusement or variety which lyme  as a public place  might offer .', 'the rooms were shut up  the lodgers almost all gone  scarcely any family but of the residents left  and  as there is nothing to admire in the buildings themselves  the remarkable situation of the town  the principal street almost hurrying into the water  the walk to the cobb  skirting round the pleasant little bay  which  in the season  is animated with bathing machines and company  the cobb itself  its old wonders and new improvements  with the very beautiful line of cliffs stretching out to the east of the town  are what the stranger  s eye will seek  and a very strange stranger it must be  who does not see charms in the immediate environs of lyme  to make him wish to know it better .', 'the scenes in its neighbourhood  charmouth  with its high grounds and extensive sweeps of country  and still more  its sweet  retired bay  backed by dark cliffs  where fragments of low rock among the sands  make it the happiest spot for watching the flow of the tide  for sitting in unwearied contemplation  the woody varieties of the cheerful village of up lyme  and  above all  pinny  with its green chasms between romantic rocks  where the scattered forest trees and orchards of luxuriant growth  declare that many a generation must have passed away since the first partial falling of the cliff prepared the ground for such a state  where a scene so wonderful and so lovely is exhibited  as may more than equal any of the resembling scenes of the far  famed isle of wight  these places must be visited  and visited again  to make the worth of lyme understood .', 'the party from uppercross passing down by the now deserted and melancholy looking rooms  and still descending  soon found themselves on the sea  shore  and lingering only  as all must linger and gaze on a first return to the sea  who ever deserved to look on it at all  proceeded towards the cobb  equally their object in itself and on captain wentworth  s account  for in a small house  near the foot of an old pier of unknown date  were the harvilles settled .', 'captain wentworth turned in to call on his friend  the others walked on  and he was to join them on the cobb .', 'they were by no means tired of wondering and admiring  and not even louisa seemed to feel that they had parted with captain wentworth long  when they saw him coming after them  with three companions  all well known already  by description  to be captain and mrs harville  and a captain benwick  who was staying with them .', 'captain benwick had some time ago been first lieutenant of the laconia  and the account which captain wentworth had given of him  on his return from lyme before  his warm praise of him as an excellent young man and an officer  whom he had always valued highly  which must have stamped him well in the esteem of every listener  had been followed by a little history of his private life  which rendered him perfectly interesting in the eyes of all the ladies .', 'he had been engaged to captain harville  s sister  and was now mourning her loss .', 'they had been a year or two waiting for fortune and promotion .', 'fortune came  his prize  money as lieutenant being great  promotion  too  came at last  but fanny harville did not live to know it .', 'she had died the preceding summer while he was at sea .', 'captain wentworth believed it impossible for man to be more attached to woman than poor benwick had been to fanny harville  or to be more deeply afflicted under the dreadful change .', 'he considered his disposition as of the sort which must suffer heavily  uniting very strong feelings with quiet  serious  and retiring manners  and a decided taste for reading  and sedentary pursuits .', 'to finish the interest of the story  the friendship between him and the harvilles seemed  if possible  augmented by the event which closed all their views of alliance  and captain benwick was now living with them entirely .', 'captain harville had taken his present house for half a year  his taste  and his health  and his fortune  all directing him to a residence inexpensive  and by the sea  and the grandeur of the country  and the retirement of lyme in the winter  appeared exactly adapted to captain benwick  s state of mind .', 'the sympathy and good  will excited towards captain benwick was very great .', ' and yet  said anne to herself  as they now moved forward to meet the party   he has not  perhaps  a more sorrowing heart than i have .', 'i cannot believe his prospects so blighted for ever .', 'he is younger than i am  younger in feeling  if not in fact  younger as a man .', 'he will rally again  and be happy with another .', 'they all met  and were introduced .', 'captain harville was a tall  dark man  with a sensible  benevolent countenance  a little lame  and from strong features and want of health  looking much older than captain wentworth .', 'captain benwick looked  and was  the youngest of the three  and  compared with either of them  a little man .', 'he had a pleasing face and a melancholy air  just as he ought to have  and drew back from conversation .', 'captain harville  though not equalling captain wentworth in manners  was a perfect gentleman  unaffected  warm  and obliging .', 'mrs harville  a degree less polished than her husband  seemed  however  to have the same good feelings  and nothing could be more pleasant than their desire of considering the whole party as friends of their own  because the friends of captain wentworth  or more kindly hospitable than their entreaties for their all promising to dine with them .', 'the dinner  already ordered at the inn  was at last  though unwillingly  accepted as a excuse  but they seemed almost hurt that captain wentworth should have brought any such party to lyme  without considering it as a thing of course that they should dine with them .', 'there was so much attachment to captain wentworth in all this  and such a bewitching charm in a degree of hospitality so uncommon  so unlike the usual style of give  and  take invitations  and dinners of formality and display  that anne felt her spirits not likely to be benefited by an increasing acquaintance among his brother  officers .', ' these would have been all my friends  was her thought  and she had to struggle against a great tendency to lowness .', 'on quitting the cobb  they all went in  doors with their new friends  and found rooms so small as none but those who invite from the heart could think capable of accommodating so many .', 'anne had a moment  s astonishment on the subject herself  but it was soon lost in the pleasanter feelings which sprang from the sight of all the ingenious contrivances and nice arrangements of captain harville  to turn the actual space to the best account  to supply the deficiencies of lodging  house furniture  and defend the windows and doors against the winter storms to be expected .', 'the varieties in the fitting  up of the rooms  where the common necessaries provided by the owner  in the common indifferent plight  were contrasted with some few articles of a rare species of wood  excellently worked up  and with something curious and valuable from all the distant countries captain harville had visited  were more than amusing to anne  connected as it all was with his profession  the fruit of its labours  the effect of its influence on his habits  the picture of repose and domestic happiness it presented  made it to her a something more  or less  than gratification .', 'captain harville was no reader  but he had contrived excellent accommodations  and fashioned very pretty shelves  for a tolerable collection of well  bound volumes  the property of captain benwick .', 'his lameness prevented him from taking much exercise  but a mind of usefulness and ingenuity seemed to furnish him with constant employment within .', 'he drew  he varnished  he carpentered  he glued  he made toys for the children  he fashioned new netting  needles and pins with improvements  and if everything else was done  sat down to his large fishing  net at one corner of the room .', 'anne thought she left great happiness behind her when they quitted the house  and louisa  by whom she found herself walking  burst forth into raptures of admiration and delight on the character of the navy  their friendliness  their brotherliness  their openness  their uprightness  protesting that she was convinced of sailors having more worth and warmth than any other set of men in england  that they only knew how to live  and they only deserved to be respected and loved .', 'they went back to dress and dine  and so well had the scheme answered already  that nothing was found amiss  though its being  so entirely out of season  and the  no thoroughfare of lyme  and the  no expectation of company  had brought many apologies from the heads of the inn .', 'anne found herself by this time growing so much more hardened to being in captain wentworth  s company than she had at first imagined could ever be  that the sitting down to the same table with him now  and the interchange of the common civilities attending on it  they never got beyond  was become a mere nothing .', 'the nights were too dark for the ladies to meet again till the morrow  but captain harville had promised them a visit in the evening  and he came  bringing his friend also  which was more than had been expected  it having been agreed that captain benwick had all the appearance of being oppressed by the presence of so many strangers .', 'he ventured among them again  however  though his spirits certainly did not seem fit for the mirth of the party in general .', 'while captains wentworth and harville led the talk on one side of the room  and by recurring to former days  supplied anecdotes in abundance to occupy and entertain the others  it fell to anne  s lot to be placed rather apart with captain benwick  and a very good impulse of her nature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with him .', 'he was shy  and disposed to abstraction  but the engaging mildness of her countenance  and gentleness of her manners  soon had their effect  and anne was well repaid the first trouble of exertion .', 'he was evidently a young man of considerable taste in reading  though principally in poetry  and besides the persuasion of having given him at least an evening  s indulgence in the discussion of subjects  which his usual companions had probably no concern in  she had the hope of being of real use to him in some suggestions as to the duty and benefit of struggling against affliction  which had naturally grown out of their conversation .', 'for  though shy  he did not seem reserved  it had rather the appearance of feelings glad to burst their usual restraints  and having talked of poetry  the richness of the present age  and gone through a brief comparison of opinion as to the first  rate poets  trying to ascertain whether marmion or the lady of the lake were to be preferred  and how ranked the giaour and the bride of abydos  and moreover  how the giaour was to be pronounced  he showed himself so intimately acquainted with all the tenderest songs of the one poet  and all the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony of the other  he repeated  with such tremulous feeling  the various lines which imaged a broken heart  or a mind destroyed by wretchedness  and looked so entirely as if he meant to be understood  that she ventured to hope he did not always read only poetry  and to say  that she thought it was the misfortune of poetry to be seldom safely enjoyed by those who enjoyed it completely  and that the strong feelings which alone could estimate it truly were the very feelings which ought to taste it but sparingly .', 'his looks shewing him not pained  but pleased with this allusion to his situation  she was emboldened to go on  and feeling in herself the right of seniority of mind  she ventured to recommend a larger allowance of prose in his daily study  and on being requested to particularize  mentioned such works of our best moralists  such collections of the finest letters  such memoirs of characters of worth and suffering  as occurred to her at the moment as calculated to rouse and fortify the mind by the highest precepts  and the strongest examples of moral and religious endurances .', 'captain benwick listened attentively  and seemed grateful for the interest implied  and though with a shake of the head  and sighs which declared his little faith in the efficacy of any books on grief like his  noted down the names of those she recommended  and promised to procure and read them .', 'when the evening was over  anne could not but be amused at the idea of her coming to lyme to preach patience and resignation to a young man whom she had never seen before  nor could she help fearing  on more serious reflection  that  like many other great moralists and preachers  she had been eloquent on a point in which her own conduct would ill bear examination .', 'chapter ', 'anne and henrietta  finding themselves the earliest of the party the next morning  agreed to stroll down to the sea before breakfast .', 'they went to the sands  to watch the flowing of the tide  which a fine south  easterly breeze was bringing in with all the grandeur which so flat a shore admitted .', 'they praised the morning  gloried in the sea  sympathized in the delight of the fresh  feeling breeze  and were silent  till henrietta suddenly began again with ', ' oh ', 'yes  i am quite convinced that  with very few exceptions  the sea  air always does good .', 'there can be no doubt of its having been of the greatest service to dr shirley  after his illness  last spring twelve  month .', 'he declares himself  that coming to lyme for a month  did him more good than all the medicine he took  and  that being by the sea  always makes him feel young again .', 'now  i cannot help thinking it a pity that he does not live entirely by the sea .', 'i do think he had better leave uppercross entirely  and fix at lyme .', 'do not you  anne ', 'do not you agree with me  that it is the best thing he could do  both for himself and mrs shirley ', 'she has cousins here  you know  and many acquaintance  which would make it cheerful for her  and i am sure she would be glad to get to a place where she could have medical attendance at hand  in case of his having another seizure .', 'indeed i think it quite melancholy to have such excellent people as dr and mrs shirley  who have been doing good all their lives  wearing out their last days in a place like uppercross  where  excepting our family  they seem shut out from all the world .', 'i wish his friends would propose it to him .', 'i really think they ought .', 'and  as to procuring a dispensation  there could be no difficulty at his time of life  and with his character .', 'my only doubt is  whether anything could persuade him to leave his parish .', 'he is so very strict and scrupulous in his notions  over  scrupulous i must say .', 'do not you think  anne  it is being over  scrupulous ', 'do not you think it is quite a mistaken point of conscience  when a clergyman sacrifices his health for the sake of duties  which may be just as well performed by another person ', 'and at lyme too  only seventeen miles off  he would be near enough to hear  if people thought there was anything to complain of .', 'anne smiled more than once to herself during this speech  and entered into the subject  as ready to do good by entering into the feelings of a young lady as of a young man  though here it was good of a lower standard  for what could be offered but general acquiescence ', 'she said all that was reasonable and proper on the business  felt the claims of dr shirley to repose as she ought  saw how very desirable it was that he should have some active  respectable young man  as a resident curate  and was even courteous enough to hint at the advantage of such resident curate  s being married .', ' i wish  said henrietta  very well pleased with her companion   i wish lady russell lived at uppercross  and were intimate with dr shirley .', 'i have always heard of lady russell as a woman of the greatest influence with everybody ', 'i always look upon her as able to persuade a person to anything ', 'i am afraid of her  as i have told you before  quite afraid of her  because she is so very clever  but i respect her amazingly  and wish we had such a neighbour at uppercross .', 'anne was amused by henrietta  s manner of being grateful  and amused also that the course of events and the new interests of henrietta  s views should have placed her friend at all in favour with any of the musgrove family  she had only time  however  for a general answer  and a wish that such another woman were at uppercross  before all subjects suddenly ceased  on seeing louisa and captain wentworth coming towards them .', 'they came also for a stroll till breakfast was likely to be ready  but louisa recollecting  immediately afterwards that she had something to procure at a shop  invited them all to go back with her into the town .', 'they were all at her disposal .', 'when they came to the steps  leading upwards from the beach  a gentleman  at the same moment preparing to come down  politely drew back  and stopped to give them way .', 'they ascended and passed him  and as they passed  anne  s face caught his eye  and he looked at her with a degree of earnest admiration  which she could not be insensible of .', 'she was looking remarkably well  her very regular  very pretty features  having the bloom and freshness of youth restored by the fine wind which had been blowing on her complexion  and by the animation of eye which it had also produced .', 'it was evident that the gentleman   completely a gentleman in manner  admired her exceedingly .', 'captain wentworth looked round at her instantly in a way which shewed his noticing of it .', 'he gave her a momentary glance  a glance of brightness  which seemed to say   that man is struck with you  and even i  at this moment  see something like anne elliot again .', 'after attending louisa through her business  and loitering about a little longer  they returned to the inn  and anne  in passing afterwards quickly from her own chamber to their dining  room  had nearly run against the very same gentleman  as he came out of an adjoining apartment .', 'she had before conjectured him to be a stranger like themselves  and determined that a well  looking groom  who was strolling about near the two inns as they came back  should be his servant .', 'both master and man being in mourning assisted the idea .', 'it was now proved that he belonged to the same inn as themselves  and this second meeting  short as it was  also proved again by the gentleman  s looks  that he thought hers very lovely  and by the readiness and propriety of his apologies  that he was a man of exceedingly good manners .', 'he seemed about thirty  and though not handsome  had an agreeable person .', 'anne felt that she should like to know who he was .', 'they had nearly done breakfast  when the sound of a carriage   almost the first they had heard since entering lyme  drew half the party to the window .', 'it was a gentleman  s carriage  a curricle  but only coming round from the stable  yard to the front door  somebody must be going away .', 'it was driven by a servant in mourning .', 'the word curricle made charles musgrove jump up that he might compare it with his own  the servant in mourning roused anne  s curiosity  and the whole six were collected to look  by the time the owner of the curricle was to be seen issuing from the door amidst the bows and civilities of the household  and taking his seat  to drive off .', ' ah ', 'cried captain wentworth  instantly  and with half a glance at anne   it is the very man we passed .', 'the miss musgroves agreed to it  and having all kindly watched him as far up the hill as they could  they returned to the breakfast table .', 'the waiter came into the room soon afterwards .', ' pray  said captain wentworth  immediately   can you tell us the name of the gentleman who is just gone away ', ' yes  sir  a mr elliot  a gentleman of large fortune  came in last night from sidmouth .', 'dare say you heard the carriage  sir  while you were at dinner  and going on now for crewkherne  in his way to bath and london .', ' elliot ', 'many had looked on each other  and many had repeated the name  before all this had been got through  even by the smart rapidity of a waiter .', ' bless me ', 'cried mary   it must be our cousin  it must be our mr elliot  it must  indeed ', 'charles  anne  must not it ', 'in mourning  you see  just as our mr elliot must be .', 'how very extraordinary ', 'in the very same inn with us ', 'anne  must not it be our mr elliot ', 'my father  s next heir ', 'pray sir  turning to the waiter   did not you hear  did not his servant say whether he belonged to the kellynch family ', ' no  ma  am  he did not mention no particular family  but he said his master was a very rich gentleman  and would be a baronight some day .', ' there ', 'you see ', 'cried mary in an ecstasy   just as i said ', 'heir to sir walter elliot ', 'i was sure that would come out  if it was so .', 'depend upon it  that is a circumstance which his servants take care to publish  wherever he goes .', 'but  anne  only conceive how extraordinary ', 'i wish i had looked at him more .', 'i wish we had been aware in time  who it was  that he might have been introduced to us .', 'what a pity that we should not have been introduced to each other ', 'do you think he had the elliot countenance ', 'i hardly looked at him  i was looking at the horses  but i think he had something of the elliot countenance  i wonder the arms did not strike me ', 'oh ', 'the great  coat was hanging over the panel  and hid the arms  so it did  otherwise  i am sure  i should have observed them  and the livery too  if the servant had not been in mourning  one should have known him by the livery .', ' putting all these very extraordinary circumstances together  said captain wentworth   we must consider it to be the arrangement of providence  that you should not be introduced to your cousin .', 'when she could command mary  s attention  anne quietly tried to convince her that their father and mr elliot had not  for many years  been on such terms as to make the power of attempting an introduction at all desirable .', 'at the same time  however  it was a secret gratification to herself to have seen her cousin  and to know that the future owner of kellynch was undoubtedly a gentleman  and had an air of good sense .', 'she would not  upon any account  mention her having met with him the second time  luckily mary did not much attend to their having passed close by him in their earlier walk  but she would have felt quite ill  used by anne  s having actually run against him in the passage  and received his very polite excuses  while she had never been near him at all  no  that cousinly little interview must remain a perfect secret .', ' of course  said mary   you will mention our seeing mr elliot  the next time you write to bath .', 'i think my father certainly ought to hear of it  do mention all about him .', 'anne avoided a direct reply  but it was just the circumstance which she considered as not merely unnecessary to be communicated  but as what ought to be suppressed .', 'the offence which had been given her father  many years back  she knew  elizabeth  s particular share in it she suspected  and that mr elliot  s idea always produced irritation in both was beyond a doubt .', 'mary never wrote to bath herself  all the toil of keeping up a slow and unsatisfactory correspondence with elizabeth fell on anne .', 'breakfast had not been long over  when they were joined by captain and mrs harville and captain benwick  with whom they had appointed to take their last walk about lyme .', 'they ought to be setting off for uppercross by one  and in the mean while were to be all together  and out of doors as long as they could .', 'anne found captain benwick getting near her  as soon as they were all fairly in the street .', 'their conversation the preceding evening did not disincline him to seek her again  and they walked together some time  talking as before of mr scott and lord byron  and still as unable as before  and as unable as any other two readers  to think exactly alike of the merits of either  till something occasioned an almost general change amongst their party  and instead of captain benwick  she had captain harville by her side .', ' miss elliot  said he  speaking rather low   you have done a good deed in making that poor fellow talk so much .', 'i wish he could have such company oftener .', 'it is bad for him  i know  to be shut up as he is  but what can we do ', 'we cannot part .', ' no  said anne   that i can easily believe to be impossible  but in time  perhaps  we know what time does in every case of affliction  and you must remember  captain harville  that your friend may yet be called a young mourner  only last summer  i understand .', ' ay  true enough   with a deep sigh   only june .', ' and not known to him  perhaps  so soon .', ' not till the first week of august  when he came home from the cape  just made into the grappler .', 'i was at plymouth dreading to hear of him  he sent in letters  but the grappler was under orders for portsmouth .', 'there the news must follow him  but who was to tell it ', 'not i . i would as soon have been run up to the yard  arm .', 'nobody could do it  but that good fellow   pointing to captain wentworth .', ' the laconia had come into plymouth the week before  no danger of her being sent to sea again .', 'he stood his chance for the rest  wrote up for leave of absence  but without waiting the return  travelled night and day till he got to portsmouth  rowed off to the grappler that instant  and never left the poor fellow for a week .', 'that  s what he did  and nobody else could have saved poor james .', 'you may think  miss elliot  whether he is dear to us ', 'anne did think on the question with perfect decision  and said as much in reply as her own feeling could accomplish  or as his seemed able to bear  for he was too much affected to renew the subject  and when he spoke again  it was of something totally different .', 'mrs harville  s giving it as her opinion that her husband would have quite walking enough by the time he reached home  determined the direction of all the party in what was to be their last walk  they would accompany them to their door  and then return and set off themselves .', 'by all their calculations there was just time for this  but as they drew near the cobb  there was such a general wish to walk along it once more  all were so inclined  and louisa soon grew so determined  that the difference of a quarter of an hour  it was found  would be no difference at all  so with all the kind leave  taking  and all the kind interchange of invitations and promises which may be imagined  they parted from captain and mrs harville at their own door  and still accompanied by captain benwick  who seemed to cling to them to the last  proceeded to make the proper adieus to the cobb .', 'anne found captain benwick again drawing near her .', 'lord byron  s  dark blue seas  could not fail of being brought forward by their present view  and she gladly gave him all her attention as long as attention was possible .', 'it was soon drawn  perforce another way .', 'there was too much wind to make the high part of the new cobb pleasant for the ladies  and they agreed to get down the steps to the lower  and all were contented to pass quietly and carefully down the steep flight  excepting louisa  she must be jumped down them by captain wentworth .', 'in all their walks  he had had to jump her from the stiles  the sensation was delightful to her .', 'the hardness of the pavement for her feet  made him less willing upon the present occasion  he did it  however .', 'she was safely down  and instantly  to show her enjoyment  ran up the steps to be jumped down again .', 'he advised her against it  thought the jar too great  but no  he reasoned and talked in vain  she smiled and said   i am determined i will  he put out his hands  she was too precipitate by half a second  she fell on the pavement on the lower cobb  and was taken up lifeless ', 'there was no wound  no blood  no visible bruise  but her eyes were closed  she breathed not  her face was like death .', 'the horror of the moment to all who stood around ', 'captain wentworth  who had caught her up  knelt with her in his arms  looking on her with a face as pallid as her own  in an agony of silence .', ' she is dead ', 'she is dead ', 'screamed mary  catching hold of her husband  and contributing with his own horror to make him immoveable  and in another moment  henrietta  sinking under the conviction  lost her senses too  and would have fallen on the steps  but for captain benwick and anne  who caught and supported her between them .', ' is there no one to help me ', 'were the first words which burst from captain wentworth  in a tone of despair  and as if all his own strength were gone .', ' go to him  go to him  cried anne   for heaven  s sake go to him .', 'i can support her myself .', 'leave me  and go to him .', 'rub her hands  rub her temples  here are salts  take them  take them .', 'captain benwick obeyed  and charles at the same moment  disengaging himself from his wife  they were both with him  and louisa was raised up and supported more firmly between them  and everything was done that anne had prompted  but in vain  while captain wentworth  staggering against the wall for his support  exclaimed in the bitterest agony ', ' oh god ', 'her father and mother ', ' a surgeon ', 'said anne .', 'he caught the word  it seemed to rouse him at once  and saying only   true  true  a surgeon this instant  was darting away  when anne eagerly suggested ', ' captain benwick  would not it be better for captain benwick ', 'he knows where a surgeon is to be found .', 'every one capable of thinking felt the advantage of the idea  and in a moment  it was all done in rapid moments  captain benwick had resigned the poor corpse  like figure entirely to the brother  s care  and was off for the town with the utmost rapidity .', 'as to the wretched party left behind  it could scarcely be said which of the three  who were completely rational  was suffering most  captain wentworth  anne  or charles  who  really a very affectionate brother  hung over louisa with sobs of grief  and could only turn his eyes from one sister  to see the other in a state as insensible  or to witness the hysterical agitations of his wife  calling on him for help which he could not give .', 'anne  attending with all the strength and zeal  and thought  which instinct supplied  to henrietta  still tried  at intervals  to suggest comfort to the others  tried to quiet mary  to animate charles  to assuage the feelings of captain wentworth .', 'both seemed to look to her for directions .', ' anne  anne  cried charles   what is to be done next ', 'what  in heaven  s name  is to be done next ', 'captain wentworth  s eyes were also turned towards her .', ' had not she better be carried to the inn ', 'yes  i am sure  carry her gently to the inn .', ' yes  yes  to the inn  repeated captain wentworth  comparatively collected  and eager to be doing something .', ' i will carry her myself .', 'musgrove  take care of the others .', 'by this time the report of the accident had spread among the workmen and boatmen about the cobb  and many were collected near them  to be useful if wanted  at any rate  to enjoy the sight of a dead young lady  nay  two dead young ladies  for it proved twice as fine as the first report .', 'to some of the best  looking of these good people henrietta was consigned  for  though partially revived  she was quite helpless  and in this manner  anne walking by her side  and charles attending to his wife  they set forward  treading back with feelings unutterable  the ground  which so lately  so very lately  and so light of heart  they had passed along .', 'they were not off the cobb  before the harvilles met them .', 'captain benwick had been seen flying by their house  with a countenance which showed something to be wrong  and they had set off immediately  informed and directed as they passed  towards the spot .', 'shocked as captain harville was  he brought senses and nerves that could be instantly useful  and a look between him and his wife decided what was to be done .', 'she must be taken to their house  all must go to their house  and await the surgeon  s arrival there .', 'they would not listen to scruples  he was obeyed  they were all beneath his roof  and while louisa  under mrs harville  s direction  was conveyed up stairs  and given possession of her own bed  assistance  cordials  restoratives were supplied by her husband to all who needed them .', 'louisa had once opened her eyes  but soon closed them again  without apparent consciousness .', 'this had been a proof of life  however  of service to her sister  and henrietta  though perfectly incapable of being in the same room with louisa  was kept  by the agitation of hope and fear  from a return of her own insensibility .', 'mary  too  was growing calmer .', 'the surgeon was with them almost before it had seemed possible .', 'they were sick with horror  while he examined  but he was not hopeless .', 'the head had received a severe contusion  but he had seen greater injuries recovered from  he was by no means hopeless  he spoke cheerfully .', 'that he did not regard it as a desperate case  that he did not say a few hours must end it  was at first felt  beyond the hope of most  and the ecstasy of such a reprieve  the rejoicing  deep and silent  after a few fervent ejaculations of gratitude to heaven had been offered  may be conceived .', 'the tone  the look  with which  thank god ', 'was uttered by captain wentworth  anne was sure could never be forgotten by her  nor the sight of him afterwards  as he sat near a table  leaning over it with folded arms and face concealed  as if overpowered by the various feelings of his soul  and trying by prayer and reflection to calm them .', 'louisa  s limbs had escaped .', 'there was no injury but to the head .', 'it now became necessary for the party to consider what was best to be done  as to their general situation .', 'they were now able to speak to each other and consult .', 'that louisa must remain where she was  however distressing to her friends to be involving the harvilles in such trouble  did not admit a doubt .', 'her removal was impossible .', 'the harvilles silenced all scruples  and  as much as they could  all gratitude .', 'they had looked forward and arranged everything before the others began to reflect .', 'captain benwick must give up his room to them  and get another bed elsewhere  and the whole was settled .', 'they were only concerned that the house could accommodate no more  and yet perhaps  by  putting the children away in the maid  s room  or swinging a cot somewhere  they could hardly bear to think of not finding room for two or three besides  supposing they might wish to stay  though  with regard to any attendance on miss musgrove  there need not be the least uneasiness in leaving her to mrs harville  s care entirely .', 'mrs harville was a very experienced nurse  and her nursery  maid  who had lived with her long  and gone about with her everywhere  was just such another .', 'between these two  she could want no possible attendance by day or night .', 'and all this was said with a truth and sincerity of feeling irresistible .', 'charles  henrietta  and captain wentworth were the three in consultation  and for a little while it was only an interchange of perplexity and terror .', ' uppercross  the necessity of some one  s going to uppercross  the news to be conveyed  how it could be broken to mr and mrs musgrove  the lateness of the morning  an hour already gone since they ought to have been off  the impossibility of being in tolerable time .', 'at first  they were capable of nothing more to the purpose than such exclamations  but  after a while  captain wentworth  exerting himself  said ', ' we must be decided  and without the loss of another minute .', 'every minute is valuable .', 'some one must resolve on being off for uppercross instantly .', 'musgrove  either you or i must go .', 'charles agreed  but declared his resolution of not going away .', 'he would be as little incumbrance as possible to captain and mrs harville  but as to leaving his sister in such a state  he neither ought  nor would .', 'so far it was decided  and henrietta at first declared the same .', 'she  however  was soon persuaded to think differently .', 'the usefulness of her staying ', 'she who had not been able to remain in louisa  s room  or to look at her  without sufferings which made her worse than helpless ', 'she was forced to acknowledge that she could do no good  yet was still unwilling to be away  till  touched by the thought of her father and mother  she gave it up  she consented  she was anxious to be at home .', 'the plan had reached this point  when anne  coming quietly down from louisa  s room  could not but hear what followed  for the parlour door was open .', ' then it is settled  musgrove  cried captain wentworth   that you stay  and that i take care of your sister home .', 'but as to the rest  as to the others  if one stays to assist mrs harville  i think it need be only one .', 'mrs charles musgrove will  of course  wish to get back to her children  but if anne will stay  no one so proper  so capable as anne .', 'she paused a moment to recover from the emotion of hearing herself so spoken of .', 'the other two warmly agreed with what he said  and she then appeared .', ' you will stay  i am sure  you will stay and nurse her  cried he  turning to her and speaking with a glow  and yet a gentleness  which seemed almost restoring the past .', 'she coloured deeply  and he recollected himself and moved away .', 'she expressed herself most willing  ready  happy to remain .', ' it was what she had been thinking of  and wishing to be allowed to do .', 'a bed on the floor in louisa  s room would be sufficient for her  if mrs harville would but think so .', 'one thing more  and all seemed arranged .', 'though it was rather desirable that mr and mrs musgrove should be previously alarmed by some share of delay  yet the time required by the uppercross horses to take them back  would be a dreadful extension of suspense  and captain wentworth proposed  and charles musgrove agreed  that it would be much better for him to take a chaise from the inn  and leave mr musgrove  s carriage and horses to be sent home the next morning early  when there would be the farther advantage of sending an account of louisa  s night .', 'captain wentworth now hurried off to get everything ready on his part  and to be soon followed by the two ladies .', 'when the plan was made known to mary  however  there was an end of all peace in it .', 'she was so wretched and so vehement  complained so much of injustice in being expected to go away instead of anne  anne  who was nothing to louisa  while she was her sister  and had the best right to stay in henrietta  s stead ', 'why was not she to be as useful as anne ', 'and to go home without charles  too  without her husband ', 'no  it was too unkind .', 'and in short  she said more than her husband could long withstand  and as none of the others could oppose when he gave way  there was no help for it  the change of mary for anne was inevitable .', 'anne had never submitted more reluctantly to the jealous and ill  judging claims of mary  but so it must be  and they set off for the town  charles taking care of his sister  and captain benwick attending to her .', 'she gave a moment  s recollection  as they hurried along  to the little circumstances which the same spots had witnessed earlier in the morning .', 'there she had listened to henrietta  s schemes for dr shirley  s leaving uppercross  farther on  she had first seen mr elliot  a moment seemed all that could now be given to any one but louisa  or those who were wrapt up in her welfare .', 'captain benwick was most considerately attentive to her  and  united as they all seemed by the distress of the day  she felt an increasing degree of good  will towards him  and a pleasure even in thinking that it might  perhaps  be the occasion of continuing their acquaintance .', 'captain wentworth was on the watch for them  and a chaise and four in waiting  stationed for their convenience in the lowest part of the street  but his evident surprise and vexation at the substitution of one sister for the other  the change in his countenance  the astonishment  the expressions begun and suppressed  with which charles was listened to  made but a mortifying reception of anne  or must at least convince her that she was valued only as she could be useful to louisa .', 'she endeavoured to be composed  and to be just .', 'without emulating the feelings of an emma towards her henry  she would have attended on louisa with a zeal above the common claims of regard  for his sake  and she hoped he would not long be so unjust as to suppose she would shrink unnecessarily from the office of a friend .', 'in the mean while she was in the carriage .', 'he had handed them both in  and placed himself between them  and in this manner  under these circumstances  full of astonishment and emotion to anne  she quitted lyme .', 'how the long stage would pass  how it was to affect their manners  what was to be their sort of intercourse  she could not foresee .', 'it was all quite natural  however .', 'he was devoted to henrietta  always turning towards her  and when he spoke at all  always with the view of supporting her hopes and raising her spirits .', 'in general  his voice and manner were studiously calm .', 'to spare henrietta from agitation seemed the governing principle .', 'once only  when she had been grieving over the last ill  judged  ill  fated walk to the cobb  bitterly lamenting that it ever had been thought of  he burst forth  as if wholly overcome ', ' don  t talk of it  don  t talk of it  he cried .', ' oh god ', 'that i had not given way to her at the fatal moment ', 'had i done as i ought ', 'but so eager and so resolute ', 'dear  sweet louisa ', 'anne wondered whether it ever occurred to him now  to question the justness of his own previous opinion as to the universal felicity and advantage of firmness of character  and whether it might not strike him that  like all other qualities of the mind  it should have its proportions and limits .', 'she thought it could scarcely escape him to feel that a persuadable temper might sometimes be as much in favour of happiness as a very resolute character .', 'they got on fast .', 'anne was astonished to recognise the same hills and the same objects so soon .', 'their actual speed  heightened by some dread of the conclusion  made the road appear but half as long as on the day before .', 'it was growing quite dusk  however  before they were in the neighbourhood of uppercross  and there had been total silence among them for some time  henrietta leaning back in the corner  with a shawl over her face  giving the hope of her having cried herself to sleep  when  as they were going up their last hill  anne found herself all at once addressed by captain wentworth .', 'in a low  cautious voice  he said  ', ' i have been considering what we had best do .', 'she must not appear at first .', 'she could not stand it .', 'i have been thinking whether you had not better remain in the carriage with her  while i go in and break it to mr and mrs musgrove .', 'do you think this is a good plan ', 'she did  he was satisfied  and said no more .', 'but the remembrance of the appeal remained a pleasure to her  as a proof of friendship  and of deference for her judgement  a great pleasure  and when it became a sort of parting proof  its value did not lessen .', 'when the distressing communication at uppercross was over  and he had seen the father and mother quite as composed as could be hoped  and the daughter all the better for being with them  he announced his intention of returning in the same carriage to lyme  and when the horses were baited  he was off .', ' end of volume one .', 'chapter ', 'the remainder of anne  s time at uppercross  comprehending only two days  was spent entirely at the mansion house  and she had the satisfaction of knowing herself extremely useful there  both as an immediate companion  and as assisting in all those arrangements for the future  which  in mr and mrs musgrove  s distressed state of spirits  would have been difficulties .', 'they had an early account from lyme the next morning .', 'louisa was much the same .', 'no symptoms worse than before had appeared .', 'charles came a few hours afterwards  to bring a later and more particular account .', 'he was tolerably cheerful .', 'a speedy cure must not be hoped  but everything was going on as well as the nature of the case admitted .', 'in speaking of the harvilles  he seemed unable to satisfy his own sense of their kindness  especially of mrs harville  s exertions as a nurse .', ' she really left nothing for mary to do .', 'he and mary had been persuaded to go early to their inn last night .', 'mary had been hysterical again this morning .', 'when he came away  she was going to walk out with captain benwick  which  he hoped  would do her good .', 'he almost wished she had been prevailed on to come home the day before  but the truth was  that mrs harville left nothing for anybody to do .', 'charles was to return to lyme the same afternoon  and his father had at first half a mind to go with him  but the ladies could not consent .', 'it would be going only to multiply trouble to the others  and increase his own distress  and a much better scheme followed and was acted upon .', 'a chaise was sent for from crewkherne  and charles conveyed back a far more useful person in the old nursery  maid of the family  one who having brought up all the children  and seen the very last  the lingering and long  petted master harry  sent to school after his brothers  was now living in her deserted nursery to mend stockings and dress all the blains and bruises she could get near her  and who  consequently  was only too happy in being allowed to go and help nurse dear miss louisa .', 'vague wishes of getting sarah thither  had occurred before to mrs musgrove and henrietta  but without anne  it would hardly have been resolved on  and found practicable so soon .', 'they were indebted  the next day  to charles hayter  for all the minute knowledge of louisa  which it was so essential to obtain every twenty  four hours .', 'he made it his business to go to lyme  and his account was still encouraging .', 'the intervals of sense and consciousness were believed to be stronger .', 'every report agreed in captain wentworth  s appearing fixed in lyme .', 'anne was to leave them on the morrow  an event which they all dreaded .', ' what should they do without her ', 'they were wretched comforters for one another .', 'and so much was said in this way  that anne thought she could not do better than impart among them the general inclination to which she was privy  and persuaded them all to go to lyme at once .', 'she had little difficulty  it was soon determined that they would go  go to  morrow  fix themselves at the inn  or get into lodgings  as it suited  and there remain till dear louisa could be moved .', 'they must be taking off some trouble from the good people she was with  they might at least relieve mrs harville from the care of her own children  and in short  they were so happy in the decision  that anne was delighted with what she had done  and felt that she could not spend her last morning at uppercross better than in assisting their preparations  and sending them off at an early hour  though her being left to the solitary range of the house was the consequence .', 'she was the last  excepting the little boys at the cottage  she was the very last  the only remaining one of all that had filled and animated both houses  of all that had given uppercross its cheerful character .', 'a few days had made a change indeed ', 'if louisa recovered  it would all be well again .', 'more than former happiness would be restored .', 'there could not be a doubt  to her mind there was none  of what would follow her recovery .', 'a few months hence  and the room now so deserted  occupied but by her silent  pensive self  might be filled again with all that was happy and gay  all that was glowing and bright in prosperous love  all that was most unlike anne elliot ', 'an hour  s complete leisure for such reflections as these  on a dark november day  a small thick rain almost blotting out the very few objects ever to be discerned from the windows  was enough to make the sound of lady russell  s carriage exceedingly welcome  and yet  though desirous to be gone  she could not quit the mansion house  or look an adieu to the cottage  with its black  dripping and comfortless veranda  or even notice through the misty glasses the last humble tenements of the village  without a saddened heart .', 'scenes had passed in uppercross which made it precious .', 'it stood the record of many sensations of pain  once severe  but now softened  and of some instances of relenting feeling  some breathings of friendship and reconciliation  which could never be looked for again  and which could never cease to be dear .', 'she left it all behind her  all but the recollection that such things had been .', 'anne had never entered kellynch since her quitting lady russell  s house in september .', 'it had not been necessary  and the few occasions of its being possible for her to go to the hall she had contrived to evade and escape from .', 'her first return was to resume her place in the modern and elegant apartments of the lodge  and to gladden the eyes of its mistress .', 'there was some anxiety mixed with lady russell  s joy in meeting her .', 'she knew who had been frequenting uppercross .', 'but happily  either anne was improved in plumpness and looks  or lady russell fancied her so  and anne  in receiving her compliments on the occasion  had the amusement of connecting them with the silent admiration of her cousin  and of hoping that she was to be blessed with a second spring of youth and beauty .', 'when they came to converse  she was soon sensible of some mental change .', 'the subjects of which her heart had been full on leaving kellynch  and which she had felt slighted  and been compelled to smother among the musgroves  were now become but of secondary interest .', 'she had lately lost sight even of her father and sister and bath .', 'their concerns had been sunk under those of uppercross  and when lady russell reverted to their former hopes and fears  and spoke her satisfaction in the house in camden place  which had been taken  and her regret that mrs clay should still be with them  anne would have been ashamed to have it known how much more she was thinking of lyme and louisa musgrove  and all her acquaintance there  how much more interesting to her was the home and the friendship of the harvilles and captain benwick  than her own father  s house in camden place  or her own sister  s intimacy with mrs clay .', 'she was actually forced to exert herself to meet lady russell with anything like the appearance of equal solicitude  on topics which had by nature the first claim on her .', 'there was a little awkwardness at first in their discourse on another subject .', 'they must speak of the accident at lyme .', 'lady russell had not been arrived five minutes the day before  when a full account of the whole had burst on her  but still it must be talked of  she must make enquiries  she must regret the imprudence  lament the result  and captain wentworth  s name must be mentioned by both .', 'anne was conscious of not doing it so well as lady russell .', 'she could not speak the name  and look straight forward to lady russell  s eye  till she had adopted the expedient of telling her briefly what she thought of the attachment between him and louisa .', 'when this was told  his name distressed her no longer .', 'lady russell had only to listen composedly  and wish them happy  but internally her heart revelled in angry pleasure  in pleased contempt  that the man who at twenty  three had seemed to understand somewhat of the value of an anne elliot  should  eight years afterwards  be charmed by a louisa musgrove .', 'the first three or four days passed most quietly  with no circumstance to mark them excepting the receipt of a note or two from lyme  which found their way to anne  she could not tell how  and brought a rather improving account of louisa .', 'at the end of that period  lady russell  s politeness could repose no longer  and the fainter self  threatenings of the past became in a decided tone   i must call on mrs croft  i really must call upon her soon .', 'anne  have you courage to go with me  and pay a visit in that house ', 'it will be some trial to us both .', 'anne did not shrink from it  on the contrary  she truly felt as she said  in observing ', ' i think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two  your feelings are less reconciled to the change than mine .', 'by remaining in the neighbourhood  i am become inured to it .', 'she could have said more on the subject  for she had in fact so high an opinion of the crofts  and considered her father so very fortunate in his tenants  felt the parish to be so sure of a good example  and the poor of the best attention and relief  that however sorry and ashamed for the necessity of the removal  she could not but in conscience feel that they were gone who deserved not to stay  and that kellynch hall had passed into better hands than its owners .', 'these convictions must unquestionably have their own pain  and severe was its kind  but they precluded that pain which lady russell would suffer in entering the house again  and returning through the well  known apartments .', 'in such moments anne had no power of saying to herself   these rooms ought to belong only to us .', 'oh  how fallen in their destination ', 'how unworthily occupied ', 'an ancient family to be so driven away ', 'strangers filling their place ', 'no  except when she thought of her mother  and remembered where she had been used to sit and preside  she had no sigh of that description to heave .', 'mrs croft always met her with a kindness which gave her the pleasure of fancying herself a favourite  and on the present occasion  receiving her in that house  there was particular attention .', 'the sad accident at lyme was soon the prevailing topic  and on comparing their latest accounts of the invalid  it appeared that each lady dated her intelligence from the same hour of yestermorn  that captain wentworth had been in kellynch yesterday  the first time since the accident  had brought anne the last note  which she had not been able to trace the exact steps of

elliot  s not being the worse for her exertions  and had spoken of those exertions as great .', 'this was handsome  and gave her more pleasure than almost anything else could have done .', 'as to the sad catastrophe itself  it could be canvassed only in one style by a couple of steady  sensible women  whose judgements had to work on ascertained events  and it was perfectly decided that it had been the consequence of much thoughtlessness and much imprudence  that its effects were most alarming  and that it was frightful to think  how long miss musgrove  s recovery might yet be doubtful  and how liable she would still remain to suffer from the concussion hereafter ', 'the admiral wound it up summarily by exclaiming ', ' ay  a very bad business indeed .', 'a new sort of way this  for a young fellow to be making love  by breaking his mistress  s head  is not it  miss elliot ', 'this is breaking a head and giving a plaster  truly ', 'admiral croft  s manners were not quite of the tone to suit lady russell  but they delighted anne .', 'his goodness of heart and simplicity of character were irresistible .', ' now  this must be very bad for you  said he  suddenly rousing from a little reverie   to be coming and finding us here .', 'i had not recollected it before  i declare  but it must be very bad .', 'but now  do not stand upon ceremony .', 'get up and go over all the rooms in the house if you like it .', ' another time  sir  i thank you  not now .', ' well  whenever it suits you .', 'you can slip in from the shrubbery at any time  and there you will find we keep our umbrellas hanging up by that door .', 'a good place is not it ', 'but   checking himself   you will not think it a good place  for yours were always kept in the butler  s room .', 'ay  so it always is  i believe .', 'one man  s ways may be as good as another  s  but we all like our own best .', 'and so you must judge for yourself  whether it would be better for you to go about the house or not .', 'anne  finding she might decline it  did so  very gratefully .', ' we have made very few changes either  continued the admiral  after thinking a moment .', ' very few .', 'we told you about the laundry  door  at uppercross .', 'that has been a very great improvement .', 'the wonder was  how any family upon earth could bear with the inconvenience of its opening as it did  so long ', 'you will tell sir walter what we have done  and that mr shepherd thinks it the greatest improvement the house ever had .', 'indeed  i must do ourselves the justice to say  that the few alterations we have made have been all very much for the better .', 'my wife should have the credit of them  however .', 'i have done very little besides sending away some of the large looking  glasses from my dressing  room  which was your father  s .', 'a very good man  and very much the gentleman i am sure  but i should think  miss elliot   looking with serious reflection   i should think he must be rather a dressy man for his time of life .', 'such a number of looking  glasses ', 'oh lord ', 'there was no getting away from one  s self .', 'so i got sophy to lend me a hand  and we soon shifted their quarters  and now i am quite snug  with my little shaving glass in one corner  and another great thing that i never go near .', 'anne  amused in spite of herself  was rather distressed for an answer  and the admiral  fearing he might not have been civil enough  took up the subject again  to say ', ' the next time you write to your good father  miss elliot  pray give him my compliments and mrs croft  s  and say that we are settled here quite to our liking  and have no fault at all to find with the place .', 'the breakfast  room chimney smokes a little  i grant you  but it is only when the wind is due north and blows hard  which may not happen three times a winter .', 'and take it altogether  now that we have been into most of the houses hereabouts and can judge  there is not one that we like better than this .', 'pray say so  with my compliments .', 'he will be glad to hear it .', 'lady russell and mrs croft were very well pleased with each other  but the acquaintance which this visit began was fated not to proceed far at present  for when it was returned  the crofts announced themselves to be going away for a few weeks  to visit their connexions in the north of the county  and probably might not be at home again before lady russell would be removing to bath .', 'so ended all danger to anne of meeting captain wentworth at kellynch hall  or of seeing him in company with her friend .', 'everything was safe enough  and she smiled over the many anxious feelings she had wasted on the subject .', 'chapter ', 'though charles and mary had remained at lyme much longer after mr and mrs musgrove  s going than anne conceived they could have been at all wanted  they were yet the first of the family to be at home again  and as soon as possible after their return to uppercross they drove over to the lodge .', 'they had left louisa beginning to sit up  but her head  though clear  was exceedingly weak  and her nerves susceptible to the highest extreme of tenderness  and though she might be pronounced to be altogether doing very well  it was still impossible to say when she might be able to bear the removal home  and her father and mother  who must return in time to receive their younger children for the christmas holidays  had hardly a hope of being allowed to bring her with them .', 'they had been all in lodgings together .', 'mrs musgrove had got mrs harville  s children away as much as she could  every possible supply from uppercross had been furnished  to lighten the inconvenience to the harvilles  while the harvilles had been wanting them to come to dinner every day  and in short  it seemed to have been only a struggle on each side as to which should be most disinterested and hospitable .', 'mary had had her evils  but upon the whole  as was evident by her staying so long  she had found more to enjoy than to suffer .', 'charles hayter had been at lyme oftener than suited her  and when they dined with the harvilles there had been only a maid  servant to wait  and at first mrs harville had always given mrs musgrove precedence  but then  she had received so very handsome an apology from her on finding out whose daughter she was  and there had been so much going on every day  there had been so many walks between their lodgings and the harvilles  and she had got books from the library  and changed them so often  that the balance had certainly been much in favour of lyme .', 'she had been taken to charmouth too  and she had bathed  and she had gone to church  and there were a great many more people to look at in the church at lyme than at uppercross  and all this  joined to the sense of being so very useful  had made really an agreeable fortnight .', 'anne enquired after captain benwick  mary  s face was clouded directly .', 'charles laughed .', ' oh ', 'captain benwick is very well  i believe  but he is a very odd young man .', 'i do not know what he would be at .', 'we asked him to come home with us for a day or two  charles undertook to give him some shooting  and he seemed quite delighted  and  for my part  i thought it was all settled  when behold ', 'on tuesday night  he made a very awkward sort of excuse   he never shot  and he had  been quite misunderstood  and he had promised this and he had promised that  and the end of it was  i found  that he did not mean to come .', 'i suppose he was afraid of finding it dull  but upon my word i should have thought we were lively enough at the cottage for such a heart  broken man as captain benwick .', 'charles laughed again and said   now mary  you know very well how it really was .', 'it was all your doing   turning to anne .', ' he fancied that if he went with us  he should find you close by  he fancied everybody to be living in uppercross  and when he discovered that lady russell lived three miles off  his heart failed him  and he had not courage to come .', 'that is the fact  upon my honour  mary knows it is .', 'but mary did not give into it very graciously  whether from not considering captain benwick entitled by birth and situation to be in love with an elliot  or from not wanting to believe anne a greater attraction to uppercross than herself  must be left to be guessed .', 'anne  s good  will  however  was not to be lessened by what she heard .', 'she boldly acknowledged herself flattered  and continued her enquiries .', ' oh ', 'he talks of you  cried charles   in such terms  mary interrupted him .', ' i declare  charles  i never heard him mention anne twice all the time i was there .', 'i declare  anne  he never talks of you at all .', ' no  admitted charles   i do not know that he ever does  in a general way  but however  it is a very clear thing that he admires you exceedingly .', 'his head is full of some books that he is reading upon your recommendation  and he wants to talk to you about them  he has found out something or other in one of them which he thinks  oh ', 'i cannot pretend to remember it  but it was something very fine  i overheard him telling henrietta all about it  and then  miss elliot  was spoken of in the highest terms ', 'now mary  i declare it was so  i heard it myself  and you were in the other room .', ' elegance  sweetness  beauty .', 'oh ', 'there was no end of miss elliot  s charms .', ' and i am sure  cried mary  warmly   it was a very little to his credit  if he did .', 'miss harville only died last june .', 'such a heart is very little worth having  is it  lady russell ', 'i am sure you will agree with me .', ' i must see captain benwick before i decide  said lady russell  smiling .', ' and that you are very likely to do very soon  i can tell you  ma  am  said charles .', ' though he had not nerves for coming away with us  and setting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit here  he will make his way over to kellynch one day by himself  you may depend on it .', 'i told him the distance and the road  and i told him of the church  s being so very well worth seeing  for as he has a taste for those sort of things  i thought that would be a good excuse  and he listened with all his understanding and soul  and i am sure from his manner that you will have him calling here soon .', 'so  i give you notice  lady russell .', ' any acquaintance of anne  s will always be welcome to me  was lady russell  s kind answer .', ' oh ', 'as to being anne  s acquaintance  said mary   i think he is rather my acquaintance  for i have been seeing him every day this last fortnight .', ' well  as your joint acquaintance  then  i shall be very happy to see captain benwick .', ' you will not find anything very agreeable in him  i assure you  ma  am .', 'he is one of the dullest young men that ever lived .', 'he has walked with me  sometimes  from one end of the sands to the other  without saying a word .', 'he is not at all a well  bred young man .', 'i am sure you will not like him .', ' there we differ  mary  said anne .', ' i think lady russell would like him .', 'i think she would be so much pleased with his mind  that she would very soon see no deficiency in his manner .', ' so do i  anne  said charles .', ' i am sure lady russell would like him .', 'he is just lady russell  s sort .', 'give him a book  and he will read all day long .', ' yes  that he will ', 'exclaimed mary  tauntingly .', ' he will sit poring over his book  and not know when a person speaks to him  or when one drop  s one  s scissors  or anything that happens .', 'do you think lady russell would like that ', 'lady russell could not help laughing .', ' upon my word  said she   i should not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have admitted of such difference of conjecture  steady and matter of fact as i may call myself .', 'i have really a curiosity to see the person who can give occasion to such directly opposite notions .', 'i wish he may be induced to call here .', 'and when he does  mary  you may depend upon hearing my opinion  but i am determined not to judge him beforehand .', ' you will not like him  i will answer for it .', 'lady russell began talking of something else .', 'mary spoke with animation of their meeting with  or rather missing  mr elliot so extraordinarily .', ' he is a man  said lady russell   whom i have no wish to see .', 'his declining to be on cordial terms with the head of his family  has left a very strong impression in his disfavour with me .', 'this decision checked mary  s eagerness  and stopped her short in the midst of the elliot countenance .', 'with regard to captain wentworth  though anne hazarded no enquiries  there was voluntary communication sufficient .', 'his spirits had been greatly recovering lately as might be expected .', 'as louisa improved  he had improved  and he was now quite a different creature from what he had been the first week .', 'he had not seen louisa  and was so extremely fearful of any ill consequence to her from an interview  that he did not press for it at all  and  on the contrary  seemed to have a plan of going away for a week or ten days  till her head was stronger .', 'he had talked of going down to plymouth for a week  and wanted to persuade captain benwick to go with him  but  as charles maintained to the last  captain benwick seemed much more disposed to ride over to kellynch .', 'there can be no doubt that lady russell and anne were both occasionally thinking of captain benwick  from this time .', 'lady russell could not hear the door  bell without feeling that it might be his herald  nor could anne return from any stroll of solitary indulgence in her father  s grounds  or any visit of charity in the village  without wondering whether she might see him or hear of him .', 'captain benwick came not  however .', 'he was either less disposed for it than charles had imagined  or he was too shy  and after giving him a week  s indulgence  lady russell determined him to be unworthy of the interest which he had been beginning to excite .', 'the musgroves came back to receive their happy boys and girls from school  bringing with them mrs harville  s little children  to improve the noise of uppercross  and lessen that of lyme .', 'henrietta remained with louisa  but all the rest of the family were again in their usual quarters .', 'lady russell and anne paid their compliments to them once  when anne could not but feel that uppercross was already quite alive again .', 'though neither henrietta  nor louisa  nor charles hayter  nor captain wentworth were there  the room presented as strong a contrast as could be wished to the last state she had seen it in .', 'immediately surrounding mrs musgrove were the little harvilles  whom she was sedulously guarding from the tyranny of the two children from the cottage  expressly arrived to amuse them .', 'on one side was a table occupied by some chattering girls  cutting up silk and gold paper  and on the other were tressels and trays  bending under the weight of brawn and cold pies  where riotous boys were holding high revel  the whole completed by a roaring christmas fire  which seemed determined to be heard  in spite of all the noise of the others .', 'charles and mary also came in  of course  during their visit  and mr musgrove made a point of paying his respects to lady russell  and sat down close to her for ten minutes  talking with a very raised voice  but from the clamour of the children on his knees  generally in vain .', 'it was a fine family  piece .', 'anne  judging from her own temperament  would have deemed such a domestic hurricane a bad restorative of the nerves  which louisa  s illness must have so greatly shaken .', 'but mrs musgrove  who got anne near her on purpose to thank her most cordially  again and again  for all her attentions to them  concluded a short recapitulation of what she had suffered herself by observing  with a happy glance round the room  that after all she had gone through  nothing was so likely to do her good as a little quiet cheerfulness at home .', 'louisa was now recovering apace .', 'her mother could even think of her being able to join their party at home  before her brothers and sisters went to school again .', 'the harvilles had promised to come with her and stay at uppercross  whenever she returned .', 'captain wentworth was gone  for the present  to see his brother in shropshire .', ' i hope i shall remember  in future  said lady russell  as soon as they were reseated in the carriage   not to call at uppercross in the christmas holidays .', 'everybody has their taste in noises as well as in other matters  and sounds are quite innoxious  or most distressing  by their sort rather than their quantity .', 'when lady russell not long afterwards  was entering bath on a wet afternoon  and driving through the long course of streets from the old bridge to camden place  amidst the dash of other carriages  the heavy rumble of carts and drays  the bawling of newspapermen  muffin  men and milkmen  and the ceaseless clink of pattens  she made no complaint .', 'no  these were noises which belonged to the winter pleasures  her spirits rose under their influence  and like mrs musgrove  she was feeling  though not saying  that after being long in the country  nothing could be so good for her as a little quiet cheerfulness .', 'anne did not share these feelings .', 'she persisted in a very determined  though very silent disinclination for bath  caught the first dim view of the extensive buildings  smoking in rain  without any wish of seeing them better  felt their progress through the streets to be  however disagreeable  yet too rapid  for who would be glad to see her when she arrived ', 'and looked back  with fond regret  to the bustles of uppercross and the seclusion of kellynch .', 'elizabeth  s last letter had communicated a piece of news of some interest .', 'mr elliot was in bath .', 'he had called in camden place  had called a second time  a third  had been pointedly attentive .', 'if elizabeth and her father did not deceive themselves  had been taking much pains to seek the acquaintance  and proclaim the value of the connection  as he had formerly taken pains to shew neglect .', 'this was very wonderful if it were true  and lady russell was in a state of very agreeable curiosity and perplexity about mr elliot  already recanting the sentiment she had so lately expressed to mary  of his being  a man whom she had no wish to see .', 'she had a great wish to see him .', 'if he really sought to reconcile himself like a dutiful branch  he must be forgiven for having dismembered himself from the paternal tree .', 'anne was not animated to an equal pitch by the circumstance  but she felt that she would rather see mr elliot again than not  which was more than she could say for many other persons in bath .', 'she was put down in camden place  and lady russell then drove to her own lodgings  in rivers street .', 'chapter ', 'sir walter had taken a very good house in camden place  a lofty dignified situation  such as becomes a man of consequence  and both he and elizabeth were settled there  much to their satisfaction .', 'anne entered it with a sinking heart  anticipating an imprisonment of many months  and anxiously saying to herself   oh ', 'when shall i leave you again ', 'a degree of unexpected cordiality  however  in the welcome she received  did her good .', 'her father and sister were glad to see her  for the sake of shewing her the house and furniture  and met her with kindness .', 'her making a fourth  when they sat down to dinner  was noticed as an advantage .', 'mrs clay was very pleasant  and very smiling  but her courtesies and smiles were more a matter of course .', 'anne had always felt that she would pretend what was proper on her arrival  but the complaisance of the others was unlooked for .', 'they were evidently in excellent spirits  and she was soon to listen to the causes .', 'they had no inclination to listen to her .', 'after laying out for some compliments of being deeply regretted in their old neighbourhood  which anne could not pay  they had only a few faint enquiries to make  before the talk must be all their own .', 'uppercross excited no interest  kellynch very little  it was all bath .', 'they had the pleasure of assuring her that bath more than answered their expectations in every respect .', 'their house was undoubtedly the best in camden place  their drawing  rooms had many decided advantages over all the others which they had either seen or heard of  and the superiority was not less in the style of the fitting  up  or the taste of the furniture .', 'their acquaintance was exceedingly sought after .', 'everybody was wanting to visit them .', 'they had drawn back from many introductions  and still were perpetually having cards left by people of whom they knew nothing .', 'here were funds of enjoyment .', 'could anne wonder that her father and sister were happy ', 'she might not wonder  but she must sigh that her father should feel no degradation in his change  should see nothing to regret in the duties and dignity of the resident landholder  should find so much to be vain of in the littlenesses of a town  and she must sigh  and smile  and wonder too  as elizabeth threw open the folding  doors and walked with exultation from one drawing  room to the other  boasting of their space  at the possibility of that woman  who had been mistress of kellynch hall  finding extent to be proud of between two walls  perhaps thirty feet asunder .', 'but this was not all which they had to make them happy .', 'they had mr elliot too .', 'anne had a great deal to hear of mr elliot .', 'he was not only pardoned  they were delighted with him .', 'he had been in bath about a fortnight   he had passed through bath in november  in his way to london  when the intelligence of sir walter  s being settled there had of course reached him  though only twenty  four hours in the place  but he had not been able to avail himself of it  but he had now been a fortnight in bath  and his first object on arriving  had been to leave his card in camden place  following it up by such assiduous endeavours to meet  and when they did meet  by such great openness of conduct  such readiness to apologize for the past  such solicitude to be received as a relation again  that their former good understanding was completely re  established .', 'they had not a fault to find in him .', 'he had explained away all the appearance of neglect on his own side .', 'it had originated in misapprehension entirely .', 'he had never had an idea of throwing himself off  he had feared that he was thrown off  but knew not why  and delicacy had kept him silent .', 'upon the hint of having spoken disrespectfully or carelessly of the family and the family honours  he was quite indignant .', 'he  who had ever boasted of being an elliot  and whose feelings  as to connection  were only too strict to suit the unfeudal tone of the present day .', 'he was astonished  indeed  but his character and general conduct must refute it .', 'he could refer sir walter to all who knew him  and certainly  the pains he had been taking on this  the first opportunity of reconciliation  to be restored to the footing of a relation and heir  presumptive  was a strong proof of his opinions on the subject .', 'the circumstances of his marriage  too  were found to admit of much extenuation .', 'this was an article not to be entered on by himself  but a very intimate friend of his  a colonel wallis  a highly respectable man  perfectly the gentleman   and not an ill  looking man  sir walter added  who was living in very good style in marlborough buildings  and had  at his own particular request  been admitted to their acquaintance through mr elliot  had mentioned one or two things relative to the marriage  which made a material difference in the discredit of it .', 'colonel wallis had known mr elliot long  had been well acquainted also with his wife  had perfectly understood the whole story .', 'she was certainly not a woman of family  but well educated  accomplished  rich  and excessively in love with his friend .', 'there had been the charm .', 'she had sought him .', 'without that attraction  not all her money would have tempted elliot  and sir walter was  moreover  assured of her having been a very fine woman .', 'here was a great deal to soften the business .', 'a very fine woman with a large fortune  in love with him ', 'sir walter seemed to admit it as complete apology  and though elizabeth could not see the circumstance in quite so favourable a light  she allowed it be a great extenuation .', 'mr elliot had called repeatedly  had dined with them once  evidently delighted by the distinction of being asked  for they gave no dinners in general  delighted  in short  by every proof of cousinly notice  and placing his whole happiness in being on intimate terms in camden place .', 'anne listened  but without quite understanding it .', 'allowances  large allowances  she knew  must be made for the ideas of those who spoke .', 'she heard it all under embellishment .', 'all that sounded extravagant or irrational in the progress of the reconciliation might have no origin but in the language of the relators .', 'still  however  she had the sensation of there being something more than immediately appeared  in mr elliot  s wishing  after an interval of so many years  to be well received by them .', 'in a worldly view  he had nothing to gain by being on terms with sir walter  nothing to risk by a state of variance .', 'in all probability he was already the richer of the two  and the kellynch estate would as surely be his hereafter as the title .', 'a sensible man  and he had looked like a very sensible man  why should it be an object to him ', 'she could only offer one solution  it was  perhaps  for elizabeth  s sake .', 'there might really have been a liking formerly  though convenience and accident had drawn him a different way  and now that he could afford to please himself  he might mean to pay his addresses to her .', 'elizabeth was certainly very handsome  with well  bred  elegant manners  and her character might never have been penetrated by mr elliot  knowing her but in public  and when very young himself .', 'how her temper and understanding might bear the investigation of his present keener time of life was another concern and rather a fearful one .', 'most earnestly did she wish that he might not be too nice  or too observant if elizabeth were his object  and that elizabeth was disposed to believe herself so  and that her friend mrs clay was encouraging the idea  seemed apparent by a glance or two between them  while mr elliot  s frequent visits were talked of .', 'anne mentioned the glimpses she had had of him at lyme  but without being much attended to .', ' oh ', 'yes  perhaps  it had been mr elliot .', 'they did not know .', 'it might be him  perhaps .', 'they could not listen to her description of him .', 'they were describing him themselves  sir walter especially .', 'he did justice to his very gentlemanlike appearance  his air of elegance and fashion  his good shaped face  his sensible eye  but  at the same time   must lament his being very much under  hung  a defect which time seemed to have increased  nor could he pretend to say that ten years had not altered almost every feature for the worse .', 'mr elliot appeared to think that he  sir walter  was looking exactly as he had done when they last parted  but sir walter had  not been able to return the compliment entirely  which had embarrassed him .', 'he did not mean to complain  however .', 'mr elliot was better to look at than most men  and he had no objection to being seen with him anywhere .', 'mr elliot  and his friends in marlborough buildings  were talked of the whole evening .', ' colonel wallis had been so impatient to be introduced to them ', 'and mr elliot so anxious that he should ', 'and there was a mrs wallis  at present known only to them by description  as she was in daily expectation of her confinement  but mr elliot spoke of her as  a most charming woman  quite worthy of being known in camden place  and as soon as she recovered they were to be acquainted .', 'sir walter thought much of mrs wallis  she was said to be an excessively pretty woman  beautiful .', ' he longed to see her .', 'he hoped she might make some amends for the many very plain faces he was continually passing in the streets .', 'the worst of bath was the number of its plain women .', 'he did not mean to say that there were no pretty women  but the number of the plain was out of all proportion .', 'he had frequently observed  as he walked  that one handsome face would be followed by thirty  or five  and  thirty frights  and once  as he had stood in a shop on bond street  he had counted eighty  seven women go by  one after another  without there being a tolerable face among them .', 'it had been a frosty morning  to be sure  a sharp frost  which hardly one woman in a thousand could stand the test of .', 'but still  there certainly were a dreadful multitude of ugly women in bath  and as for the men ', 'they were infinitely worse .', 'such scarecrows as the streets were full of ', 'it was evident how little the women were used to the sight of anything tolerable  by the effect which a man of decent appearance produced .', 'he had never walked anywhere arm  in  arm with

 that must have been quite accidental .', 'in general she has been in very good health and very good looks since michaelmas .', ' if i thought it would not tempt her to go out in sharp winds  and grow coarse  i would send her a new hat and pelisse .', 'anne was considering whether she should venture to suggest that a gown  or a cap  would not be liable to any such misuse  when a knock at the door suspended everything .', ' a knock at the door ', 'and so late ', 'it was ten o  clock .', 'could it be mr elliot ', 'they knew he was to dine in lansdown crescent .', 'it was possible that he might stop in his way home to ask them how they did .', 'they could think of no one else .', 'mrs clay decidedly thought it mr elliot  s knock .', 'mrs clay was right .', 'with all the state which a butler and foot  boy could give  mr elliot was ushered into the room .', 'it was the same  the very same man  with no difference but of dress .', 'anne drew a little back  while the others received his compliments  and her sister his apologies for calling at so unusual an hour  but  he could not be so near without wishing to know that neither she nor her friend had taken cold the day before   c .  c  which was all as politely done  and as politely taken  as possible  but her part must follow then .', 'sir walter talked of his youngest daughter   mr elliot must give him leave to present him to his youngest daughter   there was no occasion for remembering mary  and anne  smiling and blushing  very becomingly shewed to mr elliot the pretty features which he had by no means forgotten  and instantly saw  with amusement at his little start of surprise  that he had not been at all aware of who she was .', 'he looked completely astonished  but not more astonished than pleased  his eyes brightened ', 'and with the most perfect alacrity he welcomed the relationship  alluded to the past  and entreated to be received as an acquaintance already .', 'he was quite as good  looking as he had appeared at lyme  his countenance improved by speaking  and his manners were so exactly what they ought to be  so polished  so easy  so particularly agreeable  that she could compare them in excellence to only one person  s manners .', 'they were not the same  but they were  perhaps  equally good .', 'he sat down with them  and improved their conversation very much .', 'there could be no doubt of his being a sensible man .', 'ten minutes were enough to certify that .', 'his tone  his expressions  his choice of subject  his knowing where to stop  it was all the operation of a sensible  discerning mind .', 'as soon as he could  he began to talk to her of lyme  wanting to compare opinions respecting the place  but especially wanting to speak of the circumstance of their happening to be guests in the same inn at the same time  to give his own route  understand something of hers  and regret that he should have lost such an opportunity of paying his respects to her .', 'she gave him a short account of her party and business at lyme .', 'his regret increased as he listened .', 'he had spent his whole solitary evening in the room adjoining theirs  had heard voices  mirth

'if he had but asked who the party were ', 'the name of musgrove would have told him enough .', ' well  it would serve to cure him of an absurd practice of never asking a question at an inn  which he had adopted  when quite a young man  on the principal of its being very ungenteel to be curious .', ' the notions of a young man of one or two and twenty  said he   as to what is necessary in manners to make him quite the thing  are more absurd  i believe  than those of any other set of beings in the world .', 'the folly of the means they often employ is only to be equalled by the folly of what they have in view .', 'but he must not be addressing his reflections to anne alone  he knew it  he was soon diffused again among the others  and it was only at intervals that he could return to lyme

'when he questioned  sir walter and elizabeth began to question also  but the difference in their manner of doing it could not be unfelt .', 'she could only compare mr elliot to lady russell  in the wish of really comprehending what had passed  and in the degree of concern for what she must have suffered in witnessing it .', 'he staid an hour with them .', 'the elegant little clock on the mantel  piece had struck  eleven with its silver sounds  and the watchman was beginning to be heard at a distance telling the same tale  before mr elliot or any of them seemed to feel that he had been there long .', 'anne could not have supposed it possible that her first evening in camden place could have passed so well ', 'chapter ', 'there was one point which anne  on returning to her family  would have been more thankful to ascertain even than mr elliot  s being in love with elizabeth  which was  her father  s not being in love with mrs clay  and she was very far from easy about it  when she had been at home a few hours .', 'on going down to breakfast the next morning  she found there had just been a decent pretence on the lady  s side of meaning to leave them .', 'she could imagine mrs clay to have said  that  now miss anne was come  she could not suppose herself at all wanted  for elizabeth was replying in a sort of whisper   that must not be any reason  indeed .', 'i assure you i feel it none .', 'she is nothing to me  compared with you  and she was in full time to hear her father say   my dear madam  this must not be .', 'as yet  you have seen nothing of bath .', 'you have been here only to be useful .', 'you must not run away from us now .', 'you must stay to be acquainted with mrs wallis  the beautiful mrs wallis .', 'to your fine mind  i well know the sight of beauty is a real gratification .', 'he spoke and looked so much in earnest  that anne was not surprised to see mrs clay stealing a glance at elizabeth and herself .', 'her countenance  perhaps  might express some watchfulness  but the praise of the fine mind did not appear to excite a thought in her sister .', 'the lady could not but yield to such joint entreaties  and promise to stay .', 'in the course of the same morning  anne and her father chancing to be alone together  he began to compliment her on her improved looks  he thought her  less thin in her person  in her cheeks  her skin  her complexion  greatly improved  clearer  fresher .', 'had she been using any thing in particular ', ' no  nothing .', ' merely gowland  he supposed .', ' no  nothing at all .', ' ha ', 'he was surprised at that  and added   certainly you cannot do better than to continue as you are  you cannot be better than well  or i should recommend gowland  the constant use of gowland  during the spring months .', 'mrs clay has been using it at my recommendation  and you see what it has done for her .', 'you see how it has carried away her freckles .', 'if elizabeth could but have heard this ', 'such personal praise might have struck her  especially as it did not appear to anne that the freckles were at all lessened .', 'but everything must take its chance .', 'the evil of a marriage would be much diminished  if elizabeth were also to marry .', 'as for herself  she might always command a home with lady russell .', 'lady russell  s composed mind and polite manners were put to some trial on this point  in her intercourse in camden place .', 'the sight of mrs clay in such favour  and of anne so overlooked  was a perpetual provocation to her there  and vexed her as much when she was away  as a person in bath who drinks the water  gets all the new publications  and has a very large acquaintance  has time to be vexed .', 'as mr elliot became known to her  she grew more charitable  or more indifferent  towards the others .', 'his manners were an immediate recommendation  and on conversing with him she found the solid so fully supporting the superficial  that she was at first  as she told anne  almost ready to exclaim   can this be mr elliot ', 'and could not seriously picture to herself a more agreeable or estimable man .', 'everything united in him  good understanding  correct opinions  knowledge of the world  and a warm heart .', 'he had strong feelings of family attachment and family honour  without pride or weakness  he lived with the liberality of a man of fortune  without display  he judged for himself in everything essential  without defying public opinion in any point of worldly decorum .', 'he was steady  observant  moderate  candid  never run away with by spirits or by selfishness  which fancied itself strong feeling  and yet  with a sensibility to what was amiable and lovely  and a value for all the felicities of domestic life  which characters of fancied enthusiasm and violent agitation seldom really possess .', 'she was sure that he had not been happy in marriage .', 'colonel wallis said it  and lady russell saw it  but it had been no unhappiness to sour his mind  nor  she began pretty soon to suspect  to prevent his thinking of a second choice .', 'her satisfaction in mr elliot outweighed all the plague of mrs clay .', 'it was now some years since anne had begun to learn that she and her excellent friend could sometimes think differently  and it did not surprise her  therefore  that lady russell should see nothing suspicious or inconsistent  nothing to require more motives than appeared  in mr elliot  s great desire of a reconciliation .', 'in lady russell  s view  it was perfectly natural that mr elliot  at a mature time of life  should feel it a most desirable object  and what would very generally recommend him among all sensible people  to be on good terms with the head of his family  the simplest process in the world of time upon a head naturally clear  and only erring in the heyday of youth .', 'anne presumed  however  still to smile about it  and at last to mention  elizabeth .', 'lady russell listened  and looked  and made only this cautious reply  elizabeth ', 'very well  time will explain .', 'it was a reference to the future  which anne  after a little observation  felt she must submit to .', 'she could determine nothing at present .', 'in that house elizabeth must be first  and she was in the habit of such general observance as  miss elliot  that any particularity of attention seemed almost impossible .', 'mr elliot  too  it must be remembered  had not been a widower seven months .', 'a little delay on his side might be very excusable .', 'in fact  anne could never see the crape round his hat  without fearing that she was the inexcusable one  in attributing to him such imaginations  for though his marriage had not been very happy  still it had existed so many years that she could not comprehend a very rapid recovery from the awful impression of its being dissolved .', 'however it might end  he was without any question their pleasantest acquaintance in bath  she saw nobody equal to him  and it was a great indulgence now and then to talk to him about lyme  which he seemed to have as lively a wish to see again  and to see more of  as herself .', 'they went through the particulars of their first meeting a great many times .', 'he gave her to understand that he had looked at her with some earnestness .', 'she knew it well  and she remembered another person  s look also .', 'they did not always think alike .', 'his value for rank and connexion she perceived was greater than hers .', 'it was not merely complaisance  it must be a liking to the cause  which made him enter warmly into her father and sister  s solicitudes on a subject which she thought unworthy to excite them .', 'the bath paper one morning announced the arrival of the dowager viscountess dalrymple  and her daughter  the honourable miss carteret  and all the comfort of no . camden place  was swept away for many days  for the dalrymples  in anne  s opinion  most unfortunately  were cousins of the elliots  and the agony was how to introduce themselves properly .', 'anne had never seen her father and sister before in contact with nobility  and she must acknowledge herself disappointed .', 'she had hoped better things from their high ideas of their own situation in life  and was reduced to form a wish which she had never foreseen  a wish that they had more pride  for  our cousins lady dalrymple and miss carteret   our cousins  the dalrymples  sounded in her ears all day long .', 'sir walter had once been in company with the late viscount  but had never seen any of the rest of the family  and the difficulties of the case arose from there having been a suspension of all intercourse by letters of ceremony  ever since the death of that said late viscount  when  in consequence of a dangerous illness of sir walter  s at the same time  there had been an unlucky omission at kellynch .', 'no letter of condolence had been sent to ireland .', 'the neglect had been visited on the head of the sinner  for when poor lady elliot died herself  no letter of condolence was received at kellynch  and  consequently  there was but too much reason to apprehend that the dalrymples considered the relationship as closed .', 'how to have this anxious business set to rights  and be admitted as cousins again  was the question  and it was a question which  in a more rational manner  neither lady russell nor mr elliot thought unimportant .', ' family connexions were always worth preserving  good company always worth seeking  lady dalrymple had taken a house  for three months  in laura place  and would be living in style .', 'she had been at bath the year before  and lady russell had heard her spoken of as a charming woman .', 'it was very desirable that the connexion should be renewed  if it could be done  without any compromise of propriety on the side of the elliots .', 'sir walter  however  would choose his own means  and at last wrote a very fine letter of ample explanation  regret  and entreaty  to his right honourable cousin .', 'neither lady russell nor mr elliot could admire the letter  but it did all that was wanted  in bringing three lines of scrawl from the dowager viscountess .', ' she was very much honoured  and should be happy in their acquaintance .', 'the toils of the business were over  the sweets began .', 'they visited in laura place  they had the cards of dowager viscountess dalrymple  and the honourable miss carteret  to be arranged wherever they might be most visible  and  our cousins in laura place  our cousin  lady dalrymple and miss carteret  were talked of to everybody .', 'anne was ashamed .', 'had lady dalrymple and her daughter even been very agreeable  she would still have been ashamed of the agitation they created  but they were nothing .', 'there was no superiority of manner  accomplishment  or understanding .', 'lady dalrymple had acquired the name of  a charming woman  because she had a smile and a civil answer for everybody .', 'miss carteret  with still less to say  was so plain and so awkward  that she would never have been tolerated in camden place but for her birth .', 'lady russell confessed she had expected something better  but yet  it was an acquaintance worth having  and when anne ventured to speak her opinion of them to mr elliot  he agreed to their being nothing in themselves  but still maintained that  as a family connexion  as good company  as those who would collect good company around them  they had their value .', 'anne smiled and said ', ' my idea of good company  mr elliot  is the company of clever  well  informed people  who have a great deal of conversation  that is what i call good company .', ' you are mistaken  said he gently   that is not good company  that is the best .', 'good company requires only birth  education  and manners  and with regard to education is not very nice .', 'birth and good manners are essential  but a little learning is by no means a dangerous thing in good company  on the contrary  it will do very well .', 'my cousin anne shakes her head .', 'she is not satisfied .', 'she is fastidious .', 'my dear cousin   sitting down by her   you have a better right to be fastidious than almost any other woman i know  but will it answer ', 'will it make you happy ', 'will it not be wiser to accept the society of those good ladies in laura place  and enjoy all the advantages of the connexion as far as possible ', 'you may depend upon it  that they will move in the first set in bath this winter  and as rank is rank  your being known to be related to them will have its use in fixing your family  our family let me say  in that degree of consideration which we must all wish for .', ' yes  sighed anne   we shall  indeed  be known to be related to them ', 'then recollecting herself  and not wishing to be answered  she added   i certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken to procure the acquaintance .', 'i suppose   smiling   i have more pride than any of you  but i confess it does vex me  that we should be so solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged  which we may be very sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them .', ' pardon me  dear cousin  you are unjust in your own claims .', 'in london  perhaps  in your present quiet style of living  it might be as you say  but in bath  sir walter elliot and his family will always be worth knowing  always acceptable as acquaintance .', ' well  said anne   i certainly am proud  too proud to enjoy a welcome which depends so entirely upon place .', ' i love your indignation  said he   it is very natural .', 'but here you are in bath  and the object is to be established here with all the credit and dignity which ought to belong to sir walter elliot .', 'you talk of being proud  i am called proud  i know  and i shall not wish to believe myself otherwise  for our pride  if investigated  would have the same object  i have no doubt  though the kind may seem a little different .', 'in one point  i am sure  my dear cousin   he continued  speaking lower  though there was no one else in the room   in one point  i am sure  we must feel alike .', 'we must feel that every addition to your father  s society  among his equals or superiors  may be of use in diverting his thoughts from those who are beneath him .', 'he looked  as he spoke  to the seat which mrs clay had been lately occupying  a sufficient explanation of what he particularly meant  and though anne could not believe in their having the same sort of pride  she was pleased with him for not liking mrs clay  and her conscience admitted that his wishing to promote her father  s getting great acquaintance was more than excusable in the view of defeating her .', 'chapter ', 'while sir walter and elizabeth were assiduously pushing their good fortune in laura place  anne was renewing an acquaintance of a very different description .', 'she had called on her former governess  and had heard from her of there being an old school  fellow in bath  who had the two strong claims on her attention of past kindness and present suffering .', 'miss hamilton  now mrs smith  had shewn her kindness in one of those periods of her life when it had been most valuable .', 'anne had gone unhappy to school  grieving for the loss of a mother whom she had dearly loved  feeling her separation from home  and suffering as a girl of fourteen  of strong sensibility and not high spirits  must suffer at such a time  and miss hamilton  three years older than herself  but still from the want of near relations and a settled home  remaining another year at school  had been useful and good to her in a way which had considerably lessened her misery  and could never be remembered with indifference .', 'miss hamilton had left school  had married not long afterwards  was said to have married a man of fortune  and this was all that anne had known of her  till now that their governess  s account brought her situation forward in a more decided but very different form .', 'she was a widow and poor .', 'her husband had been extravagant  and at his death  about two years before  had left his affairs dreadfully involved .', 'she had had difficulties of every sort to contend with  and in addition to these distresses had been afflicted with a severe rheumatic fever  which  finally settling in her legs  had made her for the present a cripple .', 'she had come to bath on that account  and was now in lodgings near the hot baths  living in a very humble way  unable even to afford herself the comfort of a servant  and of course almost excluded from society .', 'their mutual friend answered for the satisfaction which a visit from miss elliot would give mrs smith  and anne therefore lost no time in going .', 'she mentioned nothing of what she had heard  or what she intended  at home .', 'it would excite no proper interest there .', 'she only consulted lady russell  who entered thoroughly into her sentiments  and was most happy to convey her as near to mrs smith  s lodgings in westgate buildings  as anne chose to be taken .', 'the visit was paid  their acquaintance re  established  their interest in each other more than re  kindled .', 'the first ten minutes had its awkwardness and its emotion .', 'twelve years were gone since they had parted  and each presented a somewhat different person from what the other had imagined .', 'twelve years had changed anne from the blooming  silent  unformed girl of fifteen  to the elegant little woman of seven  and  twenty  with every beauty except bloom  and with manners as consciously right as they were invariably gentle  and twelve years had transformed the fine  looking  well  grown miss hamilton  in all the glow of health and confidence of superiority  into a poor  infirm  helpless widow  receiving the visit of her former protegee as a favour  but all that was uncomfortable in the meeting had soon passed away  and left only the interesting charm of remembering former partialities and talking over old times .', 'anne found in mrs smith the good sense and agreeable manners which she had almost ventured to depend on  and a disposition to converse and be cheerful beyond her expectation .', 'neither the dissipations of the past  and she had lived very much in the world  nor the restrictions of the present  neither sickness nor sorrow seemed to have closed her heart or ruined her spirits .', 'in the course of a second visit she talked with great openness  and anne  s astonishment increased .', 'she could scarcely imagine a more cheerless situation in itself than mrs smith  s .', 'she had been very fond of her husband  she had buried him .', 'she had been used to affluence  it was gone .', 'she had no child to connect her with life and happiness again  no relations to assist in the arrangement of perplexed affairs  no health to make all the rest supportable .', 'her accommodations were limited to a noisy parlour  and a dark bedroom behind  with no possibility of moving from one to the other without assistance  which there was only one servant in the house to afford  and she never quitted the house but to be conveyed into the warm bath .', 'yet  in spite of all this  anne had reason to believe that she had moments only of languor and depression  to hours of occupation and enjoyment .', 'how could it be ', 'she watched  observed  reflected  and finally determined that this was not a case of fortitude or of resignation only .', 'a submissive spirit might be patient  a strong understanding would supply resolution  but here was something more  here was that elasticity of mind  that disposition to be comforted  that power of turning readily from evil to good  and of finding employment which carried her out of herself  which was from nature alone .', 'it was the choicest gift of heaven  and anne viewed her friend as one of those instances in which  by a merciful appointment  it seems designed to counterbalance almost every other want .', 'there had been a time  mrs smith told her  when her spirits had nearly failed .', 'she could not call herself an invalid now  compared with her state on first reaching bath .', 'then she had  indeed  been a pitiable object  for she had caught cold on the journey  and had hardly taken possession of her lodgings before she was again confined to her bed and suffering under severe and constant pain  and all this among strangers  with the absolute necessity of having a regular nurse  and finances at that moment particularly unfit to meet any extraordinary expense .', 'she had weathered it  however  and could truly say that it had done her good .', 'it had increased her comforts by making her feel herself to be in good hands .', 'she had seen too much of the world  to expect sudden or disinterested attachment anywhere  but her illness had proved to her that her landlady had a character to preserve  and would not use her ill  and she had been particularly fortunate in her nurse  as a sister of her landlady  a nurse by profession  and who had always a home in that house when unemployed  chanced to be at liberty just in time to attend her .', ' and she  said mrs smith   besides nursing me most admirably  has really proved an invaluable acquaintance .', 'as soon as i could use my hands she taught me to knit  which has been a great amusement  and she put me in the way of making these little thread  cases  pin  cushions and card  racks  which you always find me so busy about  and which supply me with the means of doing a little good to one or two very poor families in this neighbourhood .', 'she had a large acquaintance  of course professionally  among those who can afford to buy  and she disposes of my merchandise .', 'she always takes the right time for applying .', 'everybody  s heart is open  you know  when they have recently escaped from severe pain  or are recovering the blessing of health  and nurse rooke thoroughly understands when to speak .', 'she is a shrewd  intelligent  sensible woman .', 'hers is a line for seeing human nature  and she has a fund of good sense and observation  which  as a companion  make her infinitely superior to thousands of those who having only received  the best education in the world  know nothing worth attending to .', 'call it gossip  if you will  but when nurse rooke has half an hour  s leisure to bestow on me  she is sure to have something to relate that is entertaining and profitable  something that makes one know one  s species better .', 'one likes to hear what is going on  to be au fait as to the newest modes of being trifling and silly .', 'to me  who live so much alone  her conversation  i assure you  is a treat .', 'anne  far from wishing to cavil at the pleasure  replied   i can easily believe it .', 'women of that class have great opportunities  and if they are intelligent may be well worth listening to .', 'such varieties of human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing ', 'and it is not merely in its follies  that they are well read  for they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be most interesting or affecting .', 'what instances must pass before them of ardent  disinterested  self  denying attachment  of heroism  fortitude  patience  resignation  of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices that ennoble us most .', 'a sick chamber may often furnish the worth of volumes .', ' yes  said mrs smith more doubtingly   sometimes it may  though i fear its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe .', 'here and there  human nature may be great in times of trial  but generally speaking  it is its weakness and not its strength that appears in a sick chamber  it is selfishness and impatience rather than generosity and fortitude  that one hears of .', 'there is so little real friendship in the world ', 'and unfortunately   speaking low and tremulously   there are so many who forget to think seriously till it is almost too late .', 'anne saw the misery of such feelings .', 'the husband had not been what he ought  and the wife had been led among that part of mankind which made her think worse of the world than she hoped it deserved .', 'it was but a passing emotion however with mrs smith  she shook it off  and soon added in a different tone ', ' i do not suppose the situation my friend mrs rooke is in at present  will furnish much either to interest or edify me .', 'she is only nursing mrs wallis of marlborough buildings  a mere pretty  silly  expensive  fashionable woman  i believe  and of course will have nothing to report but of lace and finery .', 'i mean to make my profit of mrs wallis  however .', 'she has plenty of money  and i intend she shall buy all the high  priced things i have in hand now .', 'anne had called several times on her friend  before the existence of such a person was known in camden place .', 'at last  it became necessary to speak of her .', 'sir walter  elizabeth and mrs clay  returned one morning from laura place  with a sudden invitation from lady dalrymple for the same evening  and anne was already engaged  to spend that evening in westgate buildings .', 'she was not sorry for the excuse .', 'they were only asked  she was sure  because lady dalrymple being kept at home by a bad cold  was glad to make use of the relationship which had been so pressed on her  and she declined on her own account with great alacrity  she was engaged to spend the evening with an old schoolfellow .', 'they were not much interested in anything relative to anne  but still there were questions enough asked  to make it understood what this old schoolfellow was  and elizabeth was disdainful  and sir walter severe .', ' westgate buildings ', 'said he   and who is miss anne elliot to be visiting in westgate buildings ', 'a mrs smith .', 'a widow mrs smith  and who was her husband ', 'one of five thousand mr smiths whose names are to be met with everywhere .', 'and what is her attraction ', 'that she is old and sickly .', 'upon my word  miss anne elliot  you have the most extraordinary taste ', 'everything that revolts other people  low company  paltry rooms  foul air  disgusting associations are inviting to you .', 'but surely you may put off this old lady till to  morrow  she is not so near her end  i presume  but that she may hope to see another day .', 'what is her age ', 'forty ', ' no  sir  she is not one  and  thirty  but i do not think i can put off my engagement  because it is the only evening for some time which will at once suit her and myself .', 'she goes into the warm bath to  morrow  and for the rest of the week  you know  we are engaged .', ' but what does lady russell think of this acquaintance ', 'asked elizabeth .', ' she sees nothing to blame in it  replied anne   on the contrary  she approves it  and has generally taken me when i have called on mrs smith .', ' westgate buildings must have been rather surprised by the appearance of a carriage drawn up near its pavement  observed sir walter .', ' sir henry russell  s widow  indeed  has no honours to distinguish her arms  but still it is a handsome equipage  and no doubt is well known to convey a miss elliot .', 'a widow mrs smith lodging in westgate buildings ', 'a poor widow barely able to live  between thirty and forty  a mere mrs smith  an every  day mrs smith  of all people and all names in the world  to be the chosen friend of miss anne elliot  and to be preferred by her to her own family connections among the nobility of england and ireland ', 'mrs smith ', 'such a name ', 'mrs clay  who had been present while all this passed  now thought it advisable to leave the room  and anne could have said much  and did long to say a little in defence of her friend  s not very dissimilar claims to theirs  but her sense of personal respect to her father prevented her .', 'she made no reply .', 'she left it to himself to recollect  that mrs smith was not the only widow in bath between thirty and forty  with little to live on  and no surname of dignity .', 'anne kept her appointment  the others kept theirs  and of course she heard the next morning that they had had a delightful evening .', 'she had been the only one of the set absent  for sir walter and elizabeth had not only been quite at her ladyship  s service themselves  but had actually been happy to be employed by her in collecting others  and had been at the trouble of inviting both lady russell and mr elliot  and mr elliot had made a point of leaving colonel wallis early  and lady russell had fresh arranged all her evening engagements in order to wait on her .', 'anne had the whole history of all that such an evening could supply from lady russell .', 'to her  its greatest interest must be  in having been very much talked of between her friend and mr elliot  in having been wished for  regretted  and at the same time honoured for staying away in such a cause .', 'her kind  compassionate visits to this old schoolfellow  sick and reduced  seemed to have quite delighted mr elliot .', 'he thought her a most extraordinary young woman  in her temper  manners  mind  a model of female excellence .', 'he could meet even lady russell in a discussion of her merits  and anne could not be given to understand so much by her friend  could not know herself to be so highly rated by a sensible man  without many of those agreeable sensations which her friend meant to create .', 'lady russell was now perfectly decided in her opinion of mr elliot .', 'she was as much convinced of his meaning to gain anne in time as of his deserving her  and was beginning to calculate the number of weeks which would free him from all the remaining restraints of widowhood  and leave him at liberty to exert his most open powers of pleasing .', 'she would not speak to anne with half the certainty she felt on the subject  she would venture on little more than hints of what might be hereafter  of a possible attachment on his side  of the desirableness of the alliance  supposing such attachment to be real and returned .', 'anne heard her  and made no violent exclamations  she only smiled  blushed  and gently shook her head .', ' i am no match  maker  as you well know  said lady russell   being much too well aware of the uncertainty of all human events and calculations .', 'i only mean that if mr elliot should some time hence pay his addresses to you  and if you should be disposed to accept him  i think there would be every possibility of your being happy together .', 'a most suitable connection everybody must consider it  but i think it might be a very happy one .', ' mr elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man  and in many respects i think highly of him  said anne   but we should not suit .', 'lady russell let this pass  and only said in rejoinder   i own that to be able to regard you as the future mistress of kellynch  the future lady elliot  to look forward and see you occupying your dear mother  s place  succeeding to all her rights  and all her popularity  as well as to all her virtues  would be the highest possible gratification to me .', 'you are your mother  s self in countenance and disposition  and if i might be allowed to fancy you such as she was  in situation and name  and home  presiding and blessing in the same spot  and only superior to her in being more highly valued ', 'my dearest anne  it would give me more delight than is often felt at my time of life

imagination and her heart were bewitched .', 'the idea of becoming what her mother had been  of having the precious name of  lady elliot  first revived in herself  of being restored to kellynch  calling it her home again  her home for ever  was a charm which she could not immediately resist .', 'lady russell said not another word  willing to leave the matter to its own operation  and believing that  could mr elliot at that moment with propriety have spoken for himself  she believed  in short  what anne did not believe .', 'the same image of mr elliot speaking for himself brought anne to composure again .', 'the charm of kellynch and of  lady elliot  all faded away .', 'she never could accept him .', 'and it was not only that her feelings were still adverse to any man save one

his character .', 'that he was a sensible man  an agreeable man  that he talked well  professed good opinions  seemed to judge properly and as a man of principle  this was all clear enough .', 'he certainly knew what was right  nor could she fix on any one article of moral duty evidently transgressed  but yet she would have been afraid to answer for his conduct .', 'she distrusted the past  if not the present .', 'the names which occasionally dropt of former associates  the allusions to former practices and pursuits  suggested suspicions not favourable of what he had been .', 'she saw that there had been bad habits  that sunday travelling had been a common thing  that there had been a period of his life  and probably not a short one  when he had been  at least  careless in all serious matters  and  though he might now think very differently  who could answer for the true sentiments of a clever  cautious man  grown old enough to appreciate a fair character ', 'how could it ever be ascertained that his mind was truly cleansed ', 'mr elliot was rational  discreet  polished  but he was not open .', 'there was never any burst of feeling  any warmth of indignation or delight  at the evil or good of others .', 'this  to anne  was a decided imperfection .', 'her early impressions were incurable .', 'she prized the frank  the open  hearted  the eager character beyond all others .',

them .', 'this was sir walter and elizabeth  s share of interest in the letter  when mrs clay had paid her tribute of more decent attention  in an enquiry after mrs charles musgrove  and her fine little boys  anne was at liberty .', 'in her own room  she tried to comprehend it .', 'well might charles wonder how captain wentworth would feel ', 'perhaps he had quitted the field  had given louisa up  had ceased to love  had found he did not love her .', 'she could not endure the idea of treachery or levity  or anything akin to ill usage between him and his friend .', 'she could not endure that

captain benwick  seemed each of them everything that would not suit the other .', 'their minds most dissimilar ', 'where could have been the attraction ', 'the answer soon presented itself .', 'it had been in situation .', 'they had been thrown together several weeks  they had been living in the same small family party  since henrietta  s coming away  they must have been depending almost entirely on each other  and louisa  just recovering from illness  had been in an interesting state  and captain benwick was not inconsolable .', 'that was a point which anne had not been able to avoid suspecting before  and instead of drawing the same conclusion as mary  from the present course of events  they served only to confirm the idea of his having felt some dawning of tenderness toward herself .', 'she did not mean  however  to derive much more from it to gratify her vanity  than mary might have allowed .', 'she was persuaded that any tolerably pleasing young woman who had listened and seemed to feel for him would have received the same compliment .', 'he had an affectionate heart .', 'he must love somebody .', 'she saw no reason against their being happy .', 'louisa had fine naval fervour to begin with  and they would soon grow more alike .', 'he would gain cheerfulness  and she would learn to be an enthusiast for scott and lord byron  nay  that was probably learnt already  of course they had fallen in love over poetry .', 'the idea of louisa musgrove turned into a person of literary taste  and sentimental reflection was amusing  but she had no doubt of its being so .', 'the day at lyme  the fall from the cobb  might influence her health  her nerves  her courage  her character to the end of her life  as thoroughly as it appeared to have influenced her fate .', 'the conclusion of the whole was  that if the woman who had been sensible of captain wentworth  s merits could be allowed to prefer another man  there was nothing in the engagement to excite lasting wonder  and if captain wentworth lost no friend by it  certainly nothing to be regretted .', 'no  it was not regret which made anne  s heart beat in spite of herself  and brought the colour into her cheeks when she thought of captain wentworth unshackled and free .', 'she had some feelings which she was ashamed to investigate .', 'they were too much like joy  senseless joy ', 'she longed to see the crofts  but when the meeting took place  it was evident that no rumour of the news had yet reached them .', 'the visit of ceremony was paid and returned  and louisa musgrove was mentioned  and captain benwick  too  without even half a smile .', 'the crofts had placed themselves in lodgings in gay street  perfectly to sir walter  s satisfaction .', 'he was not at all ashamed of the acquaintance  and did  in fact  think and talk a great deal more about the admiral  than the admiral ever thought or talked about him .', 'the crofts knew quite as many people in bath as they wished for  and considered their intercourse with the elliots as a mere matter of form  and not in the least likely to afford them any pleasure .', 'they brought with them their country habit of being almost always together .', 'he was ordered to walk to keep off the gout  and mrs croft seemed to go shares with him in everything  and to walk for her life to do him good .', 'anne saw them wherever she went .', 'lady russell took her out in her carriage almost every morning  and she never failed to think of them  and never failed to see them .', 'knowing their feelings as she did  it was a most attractive picture of happiness to her .', 'she always watched them as long as she could  delighted to fancy she understood what they might be talking of  as they walked along in happy independence  or equally delighted to see the admiral  s hearty shake of the hand when he encountered an old friend  and observe their eagerness of conversation when occasionally forming into a little knot of the navy  mrs croft looking as intelligent and keen as any of the officers around her .', 'anne was too much engaged with lady russell to be often walking herself  but it so happened that one morning  about a week or ten days after the croft  s arrival  it suited her best to leave her friend  or her friend  s carriage  in the lower part of the town  and return alone to camden place  and in walking up milsom street she had the good fortune to meet with the admiral .', 'he was standing by himself at a printshop window  with his hands behind him  in earnest contemplation of some print  and she not only might have passed him unseen  but was obliged to touch as well as address him before she could catch his notice .', 'when he did perceive and acknowledge her  however  it was done with all his usual frankness and good humour .', ' ha ', 'is it you ', 'thank you  thank you .', 'this is treating me like a friend .', 'here i am  you see  staring at a picture .', 'i can never get by this shop without stopping .', 'but what a thing here is  by way of a boat ', 'do look at it .', 'did you ever see the like ', 'what queer fellows your fine painters must be  to think that anybody would venture their lives in such a shapeless old cockleshell as that ', 'and yet here are two gentlemen stuck up in it mightily at their ease  and looking about them at the rocks and mountains  as if they were not to be upset the next moment  which they certainly must be .', 'i wonder where that boat was built ', ' laughing heartily   i would not venture over a horsepond in it .', 'well   turning away   now  where are you bound ', 'can i go anywhere for you  or with you ', 'can i be of any use ', ' none  i thank you  unless you will give me the pleasure of your company the little way our road lies together .', 'i am going home .', ' that i will  with all my heart  and farther  too .', 'yes  yes we will have a snug walk together  and i have something to tell you as we go along .', 'there  take my arm  that  s right  i do not feel comfortable if i have not a woman there .', 'lord ', 'what a boat it is ', 'taking a last look at the picture  as they began to be in motion .', ' did you say that you had something to tell me  sir ', ' yes  i have  presently .', 'but here comes a friend  captain brigden  i shall only say   how d  ye do ', 'as we pass  however .', 'i shall not stop .', ' how d  ye do ', 'brigden stares to see anybody with me but my wife .', 'she  poor soul  is tied by the leg .', 'she has a blister on one of her heels  as large as a three  shilling piece .', 'if you look across the street  you will see admiral brand coming down and his brother .', 'shabby fellows  both of them ', 'i am glad they are not on this side of the way .', 'sophy cannot bear them .', 'they played me a pitiful trick once  got away with some of my best men .', 'i will tell you the whole story another time .', 'there comes old sir archibald drew and his grandson .', 'look  he sees us  he kisses his hand to you  he takes you for my wife .', 'ah ', 'the peace has come too soon for that younker .', 'poor old sir archibald ', 'how do you like bath  miss elliot ', 'it suits us very well .', 'we are always meeting with some old friend or other  the streets full of them every morning  sure to have plenty of chat  and then we get away from them all  and shut ourselves in our lodgings  and draw in our chairs  and are snug as if we were at kellynch  ay  or as we used to be even at north yarmouth and deal .', 'we do not like our lodgings here the worse  i can tell you  for putting us in mind of those we first had at north yarmouth .', 'the wind blows through one of the cupboards just in the same way .', 'when they were got a little farther  anne ventured to press again for what he had to communicate .', 'she hoped when clear of milsom street to have her curiosity gratified  but she was still obliged to wait  for the admiral had made up his mind not to begin till they had gained the greater space and quiet of belmont  and as she was not really mrs croft  she must let him have his own way .', 'as soon as they were fairly ascending belmont  he began ', ' well  now you shall hear something that will surprise you .', 'but first of all  you must tell me the name of the young lady i am going to talk about .', 'that young lady  you know  that we have all been so concerned for .', 'the miss musgrove  that all this has been happening to .', 'her christian name  i always forget her christian name .', 'anne had been ashamed to appear to comprehend so soon as she really did  but now she could safely suggest the name of  louisa .', ' ay  ay  miss louisa musgrove  that is the name .', 'i wish young ladies had not such a number of fine christian names .', 'i should never be out if they were all sophys  or something of that sort .', 'well  this miss louisa  we all thought  you know  was to marry frederick .', 'he was courting her week after week .', 'the only wonder was  what they could be waiting for  till the business at lyme came  then  indeed  it was clear enough that they must wait till her brain was set to right .', 'but even then there was something odd in their way of going on .', 'instead of staying at lyme  he went off to plymouth  and then he went off to see edward .', 'when we came back from minehead he was gone down to edward  s  and there he has been ever since .', 'we have seen nothing of him since november .', 'even sophy could not understand it .', 'but now  the matter has take the strangest turn of all  for this young lady  the same miss musgrove  instead of being to marry frederick  is to marry james benwick .', 'you know james benwick .', ' a little .', 'i am a little acquainted with captain benwick .', ' well  she is to marry him .', 'nay  most likely they are married already  for i do not know what they should wait for .', ' i thought captain benwick a very pleasing young man  said anne   and i understand that he bears an excellent character .', ' oh ', 'yes  yes  there is not a word to be said against james benwick .', 'he is only a commander  it is true  made last summer  and these are bad times for getting on  but he has not another fault that i know of .', 'an excellent  good  hearted fellow  i assure you  a very active  zealous officer too  which is more than you would think for  perhaps  for that soft sort of manner does not do him justice .', ' indeed you are mistaken there  sir  i should never augur want of spirit from captain benwick  s manners .', 'i thought them particularly pleasing  and i will answer for it  they would generally please .', ' well  well  ladies are the best judges  but james benwick is rather too piano for me  and though very likely it is all our partiality  sophy and i cannot help thinking frederick  s manners better than his .', 'there is something about frederick more to our taste .', 'anne was caught .', 'she had only meant to oppose the too common idea of spirit and gentleness being incompatible with each other  not at all to represent captain benwick  s manners as the very best that could possibly be  and  after a little hesitation  she was beginning to say   i was not entering into any comparison of the two friends  but the admiral interrupted her with ', ' and the thing is certainly true .', 'it is not a mere bit of gossip .', 'we have it from frederick himself .', 'his sister had a letter from him yesterday  in which he tells us of it  and he had just had it in a letter from harville  written upon the spot  from uppercross .', 'i fancy they are all at uppercross .', 'this was an opportunity which anne could not resist  she said  therefore   i hope  admiral  i hope there is nothing in the style of captain wentworth  s letter to make you and mrs croft particularly uneasy .', 'it did seem  last autumn  as if there were an attachment between him and louisa musgrove  but i hope it may be understood to have worn out on each side equally  and without violence .', 'i hope his letter does not breathe the spirit of an ill  used man .', ' not at all  not at all  there is not an oath or a murmur from beginning to end .', 'anne looked down to hide her smile .', ' no  no  frederick is not a man to whine and complain  he has too much spirit for that .', 'if the girl likes another man better  it is very fit she should have him .', ' certainly .', 'but what i mean is  that i hope there is nothing in captain wentworth  s manner of writing to make you suppose he thinks himself ill  used by his friend  which might appear  you know  without its being absolutely said .', 'i should be very sorry that such a friendship as has subsisted between him and captain benwick should be destroyed  or even wounded  by a circumstance of this sort .', ' yes  yes  i understand you .', 'but there is nothing at all of that nature in the letter .', 'he does not give the least fling at benwick  does not so much as say   i wonder at it  i have a reason of my own for wondering at it .', 'no  you would not guess  from his way of writing  that he had ever thought of this miss  what  s her name ', 'for himself .', 'he very handsomely hopes they will be happy together  and there is nothing very unforgiving in that  i think .', 'anne did not receive the perfect conviction which the admiral meant to convey  but it would have been useless to press the enquiry farther .', 'she therefore satisfied herself with common  place remarks or quiet attention  and the admiral had it all his own way .', ' poor frederick ', 'said he at last .', ' now he must begin all over again with somebody else .', 'i think we must get him to bath .', 'sophy must write  and beg him to come to bath .', 'here are pretty girls enough  i am sure .', 'it would be of no use to go to uppercross again  for that other miss musgrove  i find  is bespoke by her cousin  the young parson .', 'do not you think  miss elliot  we had better try to get him to bath ', 'chapter ', 'while admiral croft was taking this walk with anne  and expressing his wish of getting captain wentworth to bath  captain wentworth was already on his way thither .', 'before mrs croft had written  he was arrived  and the very next time anne walked out  she saw him .', 'mr elliot was attending his two cousins and mrs clay .', 'they were in milsom street .', 'it began to rain  not much  but enough to make shelter desirable for women  and quite enough to make it very desirable for miss elliot to have the advantage of being conveyed home in lady dalrymple  s carriage  which was seen waiting at a little distance  she  anne  and mrs clay  therefore  turned into molland  s  while mr elliot stepped to lady dalrymple  to request her assistance .', 'he soon joined them again  successful  of course  lady dalrymple would be most happy to take them home  and would call for them in a few minutes .', 'her ladyship  s carriage was a barouche  and did not hold more than four with any comfort .', 'miss carteret was with her mother  consequently it was not reasonable to expect accommodation for all the three camden place ladies .', 'there could be no doubt as to miss elliot .', 'whoever suffered inconvenience  she must suffer none  but it occupied a little time to settle the point of civility between the other two .', 'the rain was a mere trifle  and anne was most sincere in preferring a walk with mr elliot .', 'but the rain was also a mere trifle to mrs clay  she would hardly allow it even to drop at all  and her boots were so thick ', 'much thicker than miss anne  s  and  in short  her civility rendered her quite as anxious to be left to walk with mr elliot as anne could be  and it was discussed between them with a generosity so polite and so determined  that the others were obliged to settle it for them  miss elliot maintaining that mrs clay had a little cold already  and mr elliot deciding on appeal  that his cousin anne  s boots were rather the thickest .', 'it was fixed accordingly  that mrs clay should be of the party in the carriage  and they had just reached this point  when anne  as she sat near the window  descried  most decidedly and distinctly  captain wentworth walking down the street .', 'her start was perceptible only to herself  but she instantly felt that she was the greatest simpleton in the world  the most unaccountable and absurd ', 'for a few minutes she saw nothing before her  it was all confusion .', 'she was lost  and when she had scolded back her senses  she found the others still waiting for the carriage  and mr elliot  always obliging  just setting off for union street on a commission of mrs clay  s .', 'she now felt a great inclination to go to the outer door  she wanted to see if it rained .', 'why was she to suspect herself of another motive ', 'captain wentworth must be out of sight .', 'she left her seat  she would go  one half of her should not be always so much wiser than the other half  or always suspecting the other of being worse than it was .', 'she would see if it rained .', 'she was sent back  however  in a moment by the entrance of captain wentworth himself  among a party of gentlemen and ladies  evidently his acquaintance  and whom he must have joined a little below milsom street .', 'he was more obviously struck and confused by the sight of her than she had ever observed before  he looked quite red .', 'for the first time  since their renewed acquaintance  she felt that she was betraying the least sensibility of the two .', 'she had the advantage of him in the preparation of the last few moments .', 'all the overpowering  blinding  bewildering  first effects of strong surprise were over with her .', 'still  however  she had enough to feel ', 'it was agitation  pain  pleasure  a something between delight and misery .', 'he spoke to her  and then turned away .', 'the character of his manner was embarrassment .', 'she could not have called it either cold or friendly  or anything so certainly as embarrassed .', 'after a short interval  however  he came towards her  and spoke again .', 'mutual enquiries on common subjects passed  neither of them  probably  much the wiser for what they heard  and anne continuing fully sensible of his being less at ease than formerly .', 'they had by dint of being so very much together  got to speak to each other with a considerable portion of apparent indifference and calmness  but he could not do it now .', 'time had changed him  or louisa had changed him .', 'there was consciousness of some sort or other .', 'he looked very well  not as if he had been suffering in health or spirits  and he talked of uppercross  of the musgroves  nay  even of louisa  and had even a momentary look of his own arch significance as he named her  but yet it was captain wentworth not comfortable  not easy  not able to feign that he was .', 'it did not surprise  but it grieved anne to observe that elizabeth would not know him .', 'she saw that he saw elizabeth  that elizabeth saw him  that there was complete internal recognition on each side  she was convinced that he was ready to be acknowledged as an acquaintance  expecting it  and she had the pain of seeing her sister turn away with unalterable coldness .', 'lady dalrymple  s carriage  for which miss elliot was growing very impatient  now drew up  the servant came in to announce it .', 'it was beginning to rain again  and altogether there was a delay  and a bustle  and a talking  which must make all the little crowd in the shop understand that lady dalrymple was calling to convey miss elliot .', 'at last miss elliot and her friend  unattended but by the servant   for there was no cousin returned  were walking off  and captain wentworth  watching them  turned again to anne  and by manner  rather than words  was offering his services to her .', ' i am much obliged to you  was her answer   but i am not going with them .', 'the carriage would not accommodate so many .', 'i walk  i prefer walking .', ' but it rains .', ' oh ', 'very little  nothing that i regard .', 'after a moment  s pause he said   though i came only yesterday  i have equipped myself properly for bath already  you see   pointing to a new umbrella   i wish you would make use of it  if you are determined to walk  though i think it would be more prudent to let me get you a chair .', 'she was very much obliged to him  but declined it all  repeating her conviction  that the rain would come to nothing at present  and adding   i am only waiting for mr elliot .', 'he will be here in a moment  i am sure .', 'she had hardly spoken the words when mr elliot walked in .', 'captain wentworth recollected him perfectly .', 'there was no difference between him and the man who had stood on the steps at lyme  admiring anne as she passed  except in the air and look and manner of the privileged relation and friend .', 'he came in with eagerness  appeared to see and think only of her  apologised for his stay  was grieved to have kept her waiting  and anxious to get her away without further loss of time and before the rain increased  and in another moment they walked off together  her arm under his  a gentle and embarrassed glance  and a  good morning to you ', 'being all that she had time for  as she passed away .', 'as soon as they were out of sight  the ladies of captain wentworth  s party began talking of them .', ' mr elliot does not dislike his cousin  i fancy ', ' oh ', 'no  that is clear enough .', 'one can guess what will happen there .', 'he is always with them  half lives in the family  i believe .', 'what a very good  looking man ', ' yes  and miss atkinson  who dined with him once at the wallises  says he is the most agreeable man she

just now she could think only of captain wentworth .', 'she could not understand his present feelings  whether he were really suffering much from disappointment or not  and till that point were settled  she could not be quite herself .', 'she hoped to be wise and reasonable in time  but alas ', 'alas ', 'she must confess to herself that she was not wise yet .', 'another circumstance very essential for her to know  was how long he meant to be in bath  he had not mentioned it  or she could not recollect it .', 'he might be only passing through .', 'but it was more probable that he should be come to stay .', 'in that case  so liable as every body was to meet every body in bath  lady russell would in all likelihood see him somewhere .', 'would she recollect him ', 'how would it all be ', 'she had already been obliged to tell lady russell that louisa musgrove was to marry captain benwick .', 'it had cost her something to encounter lady russell  s surprise  and now  if she were by any chance to be thrown into company with captain wentworth  her imperfect knowledge of the matter might add another shade of prejudice against him .', 'the following morning anne was out with her friend  and for the first hour  in an incessant and fearful sort of watch for him in vain  but at last  in returning down pulteney street  she distinguished him on the right hand pavement at such a distance as to have him in view the greater part of the street .', 'there were many other men about him  many groups walking the same way  but there was no mistaking him .', 'she looked instinctively at lady russell  but not from any mad idea of her recognising him so soon as she did herself .', 'no  it was not to be supposed that lady russell would perceive him till they were nearly opposite .', 'she looked at her however  from time to time  anxiously  and when the moment approached which must point him out  though not daring to look again  for her own countenance she knew was unfit to be seen  she was yet perfectly conscious of lady russell  s eyes being turned exactly in the direction for him  of her being  in short  intently observing him .', 'she could thoroughly comprehend the sort of fascination he must possess over lady russell  s mind  the difficulty it must be for her to withdraw her eyes  the astonishment she must be feeling that eight or nine years should have passed over him  and in foreign climes and in active service too  without robbing him of one personal grace ', 'at last  lady russell drew back her head .', ' now  how would she speak of him ', ' you will wonder  said she   what has been fixing my eye so long  but i was looking after some window  curtains  which lady alicia and mrs frankland were telling me of last night .', 'they described the drawing  room window  curtains of one of the houses on this side of the way  and this part of the street  as being the handsomest and best hung of any in bath  but could not recollect the exact number  and i have been trying to find out which it could be  but i confess i can see no curtains hereabouts that answer their description .', 'anne sighed and blushed and smiled  in pity and disdain  either at her friend or herself .', 'the part which provoked her most  was that in all this waste of foresight and caution  she should have lost the right moment for seeing whether he saw them .', 'a day or two passed without producing anything .', 'the theatre or the rooms  where he was most likely to be  were not fashionable enough for the elliots  whose evening amusements were solely in the elegant stupidity of private parties  in which they were getting more and more engaged  and anne  wearied of such a state of stagnation  sick of knowing nothing  and fancying herself stronger because her strength was not tried  was quite impatient for the concert evening .', 'it was a concert for the benefit of a person patronised by lady dalrymple .', 'of course they must attend .', 'it was really expected to be a good one  and captain wentworth was very fond of music .', 'if she could only have a few minutes conversation with him again  she fancied she should be satisfied  and as to the power of addressing him  she felt all over courage if the opportunity occurred .', 'elizabeth had turned from him  lady russell overlooked him  her nerves were strengthened by these circumstances  she felt that she owed him attention .', 'she had once partly promised mrs smith to spend the evening with her  but in a short hurried call she excused herself and put it off  with the more decided promise of a longer visit on the morrow .', 'mrs smith gave a most good  humoured acquiescence .', ' by all means  said she   only tell me all about it  when you do come .', 'who is your party ', 'anne named them all .', 'mrs smith made no reply  but when she was leaving her said  and with an expression half serious  half arch   well  i heartily wish your concert may answer  and do not fail me to  morrow if you can come  for i begin to have a foreboding that i may not have many more visits from you .', 'anne was startled and confused  but after standing in a moment  s suspense  was obliged  and not sorry to be obliged  to hurry away .', 'chapter ', 'sir walter  his two daughters  and mrs clay  were the earliest of all their party at the rooms in the evening  and as lady dalrymple must be waited for  they took their station by one of the fires in the octagon room .', 'but hardly were they so settled  when the door opened again  and captain wentworth walked in alone .', 'anne was the nearest to him  and making yet a little advance  she instantly spoke .', 'he was preparing only to bow and pass on  but her gentle  how do you do ', 'brought him out of the straight line to stand near her  and make enquiries in return  in spite of the formidable father and sister in the back ground .', 'their being in the back ground was a support to anne  she knew nothing of their looks  and felt equal to everything which she believed right to be done .', 'while they were speaking  a whispering between her father and elizabeth caught her ear .', 'she could not distinguish  but she must guess the subject  and on captain wentworth  s making a distant bow  she comprehended that her father had judged so well as to give him that simple acknowledgement of acquaintance  and she was just in time by a side glance to see a slight curtsey from elizabeth herself .', 'this  though late  and reluctant  and ungracious  was yet better than nothing  and her spirits improved .', 'after talking  however  of the weather  and bath  and the concert  their conversation began to flag  and so little was said at last  that she was expecting him to go every moment  but he did not  he seemed in no hurry to leave her  and presently with renewed spirit  with a little smile  a little glow  he said ', ' i have hardly seen you since our day at lyme .', 'i am afraid you must have suffered from the shock  and the more from its not overpowering you at the time .', 'she assured him that she had not .', ' it was a frightful hour  said he   a frightful day ', 'and he passed his hand across his eyes  as if the remembrance were still too painful  but in a moment  half smiling again  added   the day has produced some effects however  has had some consequences which must be considered as the very reverse of frightful .', 'when you had the presence of mind to suggest that benwick would be the properest person to fetch a surgeon  you could have little idea of his being eventually one of those most concerned in her recovery .', ' certainly i could have none .', 'but it appears  i should hope it would be a very happy match .', 'there are on both sides good principles and good temper .', ' yes  said he  looking not exactly forward   but there  i think  ends the resemblance .', 'with all my soul i wish them happy  and rejoice over every circumstance in favour of it .', 'they have no difficulties to contend with at home  no opposition  no caprice  no delays .', 'the musgroves are behaving like themselves  most honourably and kindly  only anxious with true parental hearts to promote their daughter  s comfort .', 'all this is much  very much in favour of their happiness  more than perhaps ', 'he stopped .', 'a sudden recollection seemed to occur  and to give him some taste of that emotion which was reddening anne  s cheeks and fixing her eyes on the ground .', 'after clearing his throat  however  he proceeded thus ', ' i confess that i do think there is a disparity  too great a disparity  and in a point no less essential than mind .', 'i regard louisa musgrove as a very amiable  sweet  tempered girl  and not deficient in understanding  but benwick is something more .', 'he is a clever man  a reading man  and i confess  that i do consider his attaching himself to her with some surprise .', 'had it been the effect of gratitude  had he learnt to love her  because he believed her to be preferring him  it would have been another thing .', 'but i have no reason to suppose it so .', 'it seems  on the contrary  to have been a perfectly spontaneous  untaught feeling on his side  and this surprises me .', 'a man like him  in his situation ', 'with a heart pierced  wounded  almost broken ', 'fanny harville was a very superior creature  and his attachment to her was indeed attachment .', 'a man does not recover from such a devotion of the heart to such a woman .', 'he ought not  he does not .', 'either from the consciousness  however  that his friend had recovered  or from other consciousness  he went no farther  and anne who  in spite of the agitated voice in which the latter part had been uttered  and in spite of all the various noises of the room  the almost ceaseless slam of the door  and ceaseless buzz of persons walking through  had distinguished every word  was struck  gratified  confused  and beginning to breathe very quick  and feel an hundred things in a moment .', 'it was impossible for her to enter on such a subject  and yet  after a pause  feeling the necessity of speaking  and having not the smallest wish for a total change  she only deviated so far as to say ', ' you were a good while at lyme  i think ', ' about a fortnight .', 'i could not leave it till louisa  s doing well was quite ascertained .', 'i had been too deeply concerned in the mischief to be soon at peace .', 'it had been my doing  solely mine .', 'she would not have been obstinate if i had not been weak .', 'the country round lyme is very fine .', 'i walked and rode a great deal  and the more i saw  the more i found to admire .', ' i should very much like to see lyme again  said anne .', ' indeed ', 'i should not have supposed that you could have found anything in lyme to inspire such a feeling .', 'the horror and distress you were involved in  the stretch of mind  the wear of spirits ', 'i should have thought your last impressions of lyme must have been strong disgust .', ' the last hours were certainly very painful  replied anne   but when pain is over  the remembrance of it often becomes a pleasure .', 'one does not love a place the less for having suffered in it  unless it has been all suffering  nothing but suffering  which was by no means the case at lyme .', 'we were only in anxiety and distress during the last two hours  and previously there had been a great deal of enjoyment .', 'so much novelty and beauty ', 'i have travelled so little  that every fresh place would be interesting to me  but there is real beauty at lyme  and in short   with a faint blush at some recollections   altogether my impressions of the place are very agreeable .', 'as she ceased  the entrance door opened again  and the very party appeared for whom they were waiting .', ' lady dalrymple  lady dalrymple  was the rejoicing sound  and with all the eagerness compatible with anxious elegance  sir walter and his two ladies stepped forward to meet her .', 'lady dalrymple and miss carteret  escorted by mr elliot and colonel wallis  who had happened to arrive nearly at the same instant  advanced into the room .', 'the others joined them  and it was a group in which anne found herself also necessarily included .', 'she was divided from captain wentworth .', 'their interesting  almost too interesting conversation must be broken up for a time  but slight was the penance compared with the happiness which brought it on ', 'she had learnt  in the last ten minutes  more of his feelings towards louisa  more of all his feelings than she dared to think of  and she gave herself up to the demands of the party  to the needful civilities of the moment  with exquisite  though agitated sensations .', 'she was in good humour with all .', 'she had received ideas which disposed her to be courteous and kind to all  and to pity every one  as being less happy than herself .', 'the delightful emotions were a little subdued  when on stepping back from the group  to be joined again by captain wentworth  she saw that he was gone .', 'she was just in time to see him turn into the concert room .', 'he was gone  he had disappeared  she felt a moment  s regret .', 'but  they should meet again .', 'he would look for her  he would find her out before the evening were over  and at present  perhaps  it was as well to be asunder .', 'she was in need of a little interval for recollection .', 'upon lady russell  s appearance soon afterwards  the whole party was collected  and all that remained was to marshal themselves  and proceed into the concert room  and be of all the consequence in their power  draw as many eyes  excite as many whispers  and disturb as many people as they could .', 'very  very happy were both elizabeth and anne elliot as they walked in .', 'elizabeth arm in arm with miss carteret  and looking on the broad back of the dowager viscountess dalrymple before her  had nothing to wish for which did not seem within her reach  and anne  but it would be an insult to the nature of anne  s felicity  to draw any comparison between it and her sister  s  the origin of one all selfish vanity  of the other all generous attachment .', 'anne saw nothing  thought nothing of the brilliancy of the room .', 'her happiness was from within .', 'her eyes were bright and her cheeks glowed  but she knew nothing about it .', 'she was thinking only of the last half hour  and as they passed to their seats  her mind took a hasty range over it .', 'his choice of subjects  his expressions  and still more his manner and look  had been such as she could see in only one light .', 'his opinion of louisa musgrove  s inferiority  an opinion which he had seemed solicitous to give  his wonder at captain benwick  his feelings as to a first  strong attachment  sentences begun which he could not finish  his half averted eyes and more than half expressive glance  all  all declared that he had a heart returning to her at least  that anger  resentment  avoidance  were no more  and that they were succeeded  not merely by friendship and regard  but by the tenderness of the past .', 'yes  some share of the tenderness of the past .', 'she could not contemplate the change as implying less .', 'he must love her .', 'these were thoughts  with their attendant visions  which occupied and flurried her too much to leave her any power of observation  and she passed along the room without having a glimpse of him  without even trying to discern him .', 'when their places were determined on  and they were all properly arranged  she looked round to see if he should happen to be in the same part of the room  but he was not  her eye could not reach him  and the concert being just opening  she must consent for a time to be happy in a humbler way .', 'the party was divided and disposed of on two contiguous benches  anne was among those on the foremost  and mr elliot had manoeuvred so well  with the assistance of his friend colonel wallis  as to have a seat by her .', 'miss elliot  surrounded by her cousins  and the principal object of colonel wallis  s gallantry  was quite contented .', 'anne  s mind was in a most favourable state for the entertainment of the evening  it was just occupation enough  she had feelings for the tender  spirits for the gay  attention for the scientific  and patience for the wearisome  and had never liked a concert better  at least during the first act .', 'towards the close of it  in the interval succeeding an italian song  she explained the words of the song to mr elliot .', 'they had a concert bill between them .', ' this  said she   is nearly the sense  or rather the meaning of the words  for certainly the sense of an italian love  song must not be talked of  but it is as nearly the meaning as i can give  for i do not pretend to understand the language .', 'i am a very poor italian scholar .', ' yes  yes  i see you are .', 'i see you know nothing of the matter .', 'you have only knowledge enough of the language to translate at sight these inverted  transposed  curtailed italian lines  into clear  comprehensible  elegant english .', 'you need not say anything more of your ignorance .', 'here is complete proof .', ' i will not oppose such kind politeness  but i should be sorry to be examined by a real proficient .', ' i have not had the pleasure of visiting in camden place so long  replied he   without knowing something of miss anne elliot  and i do regard her as one who is too modest for the world in general to be aware of half her accomplishments  and too highly accomplished for modesty to be natural in any other woman .', ' for shame ', 'for shame ', 'this is too much flattery .', 'i forget what we are to have next  turning to the bill .', ' perhaps  said mr elliot  speaking low   i have had a longer acquaintance with your character than you are aware of .', ' indeed ', 'how so ', 'you can have been acquainted with it only since i came to bath  excepting as you might hear me previously spoken of in my own family .', ' i knew you by report long before you came to bath .', 'i had heard you described by those who knew you intimately .', 'i have been acquainted with you by character many years .', 'your person  your disposition  accomplishments  manner  they were all present to me .', 'mr elliot was not disappointed in the interest he hoped to raise .', 'no one can withstand the charm of such a mystery .', 'to have been described long ago to a recent acquaintance  by nameless people  is irresistible  and anne was all curiosity .', 'she wondered  and questioned him eagerly  but in vain .', 'he delighted in being asked  but he would not tell .', ' no  no  some time or other  perhaps  but not now .', 'he would mention no names now  but such  he could assure her  had been the fact .', 'he had many years ago received such a description of miss anne elliot as had inspired him with the highest idea of her merit  and excited the warmest curiosity to know her .', 'anne could think of no one so likely to have spoken with partiality of her many years ago as the mr wentworth of monkford  captain wentworth  s brother .', 'he might have been in mr elliot  s company  but she had not courage to ask the question .', ' the name of anne elliot  said he   has long had an interesting sound to me .', 'very long has it possessed a charm over my fancy  and  if i dared  i would breathe my wishes that the name might never change .', 'such  she believed  were his words  but scarcely had she received their sound  than her attention was caught by other sounds immediately behind her  which rendered every thing else trivial .', 'her father and lady dalrymple were speaking .', ' a well  looking man  said sir walter   a very well  looking man .', ' a very fine young man indeed ', 'said lady dalrymple .', ' more air than one often sees in bath .', 'irish  i dare say .', ' no  i just know his name .', 'a bowing acquaintance .', 'wentworth  captain wentworth of the navy .', 'his sister married my tenant in somersetshire  the croft  who rents kellynch .', 'before sir walter had reached this point  anne  s eyes had caught the right direction  and distinguished captain wentworth standing among a cluster of men at a little distance .', 'as her eyes fell on him  his seemed to be withdrawn from her .', 'it had that appearance .', 'it seemed as if she had been one moment too late  and as long as she dared observe  he did not look again  but the performance was recommencing  and she was forced to seem to restore her attention to the orchestra and look straight forward .', 'when she could give another glance  he had moved away .', 'he could not have come nearer to her if he would  she was so surrounded and shut in  but she would rather have caught his eye .', 'mr elliot  s speech  too  distressed her .', 'she had no longer any inclination to talk to him .', 'she wished him not so near her .', 'the first act was over .', 'now she hoped for some beneficial change  and  after a period of nothing  saying amongst the party  some of them did decide on going in quest of tea .', 'anne was one of the few who did not choose to move .', 'she remained in her seat  and so did lady russell  but she had the pleasure of getting rid of mr elliot  and she did not mean  whatever she might feel on lady russell  s account  to shrink from conversation with captain wentworth  if he gave her the opportunity .', 'she was persuaded by lady russell  s countenance that she had seen him .', 'he did not come however .', 'anne sometimes fancied she discerned him at a distance  but he never came .', 'the anxious interval wore away unproductively .', 'the others returned  the room filled again  benches were reclaimed and repossessed  and another hour of pleasure or of penance was to be sat out  another hour of music was to give delight or the gapes  as real or affected taste for it prevailed .', 'to anne  it chiefly wore the prospect of an hour of agitation .', 'she could not quit that room in peace without seeing captain wentworth once more  without the interchange of one friendly look .', 'in re  settling themselves there were now many changes  the result of which was favourable for her .', 'colonel wallis declined sitting down again  and mr elliot was invited by elizabeth and miss carteret  in a manner not to be refused  to sit between them  and by some other removals  and a little scheming of her own  anne was enabled to place herself much nearer the end of the bench than she had been before  much more within reach of a passer  by .', 'she could not do so  without comparing herself with miss larolles  the inimitable miss larolles  but still she did it  and not with much happier effect  though by what seemed prosperity in the shape of an early abdication in her next neighbours  she found herself at the very end of the bench before the concert closed .', 'such was her situation  with a vacant space at hand  when captain wentworth was again in sight .', 'she saw him not far off .', 'he saw her too  yet he looked grave  and seemed irresolute  and only by very slow degrees came at last near enough to speak to her .', 'she felt that something must be the matter .', 'the change was indubitable .', 'the difference between his present air and what it had been in the octagon room was strikingly great .', 'why was it ', 'she thought of her father  of lady russell .', 'could there have been any unpleasant glances ', 'he began by speaking of the concert gravely  more like the captain wentworth of uppercross  owned himself disappointed  had expected singing  and in short  must confess that he should not be sorry when it was over .', 'anne replied  and spoke in defence of the performance so well  and yet in allowance for his feelings so pleasantly  that his countenance improved  and he replied again with almost a smile .', 'they talked for a few minutes more  the improvement held  he even looked down towards the bench  as if he saw a place on it well worth occupying  when at that moment a touch on her shoulder obliged anne to turn round .', 'it came from mr elliot .', 'he begged her pardon  but she must be applied to  to explain italian again .', 'miss carteret was very anxious to have a general idea of what was next to be sung .', 'anne could not refuse  but never had she sacrificed to politeness with a more suffering spirit .', 'a few minutes  though as few as possible  were inevitably consumed  and when her own mistress again  when able to turn and look as she had done before  she found herself accosted by captain wentworth  in a reserved yet hurried sort of farewell .', ' he must wish her good night  he was going  he should get home as fast as he could .', ' is not this song worth staying for ', 'said anne  suddenly struck by an idea which made her yet more anxious to be encouraging .', ' no ', 'he replied impressively   there is nothing worth my staying for  and he was gone directly .', 'jealousy of mr elliot ', 'it was the only intelligible motive .', 'captain wentworth jealous of her affection ', 'could she have believed it a week ago  three hours ago ', 'for a moment the gratification was exquisite .', 'but  alas ', 'there were very different thoughts to succeed .', 'how was such jealousy to be quieted ', 'how was the truth to reach him ', 'how  in all the peculiar disadvantages of their respective situations  would he ever learn of her real sentiments ', 'it was misery to think of mr elliot  s attentions .', 'their evil was incalculable .', 'chapter ', 'anne recollected with pleasure the next morning her promise of going to mrs smith  meaning that it should engage her from home at the time when mr elliot would be most likely to call  for to avoid mr elliot was almost a first object .', 'she felt a great deal of good  will towards him .', 'in spite of the mischief of his attentions  she owed him gratitude and regard  perhaps compassion .', 'she could not help thinking much of the extraordinary circumstances attending their acquaintance  of the right which he seemed to have to interest her  by everything in situation  by his own sentiments  by his early prepossession .', 'it was altogether very extraordinary  flattering  but painful .', 'there was much to regret .', 'how she might have felt had there been no captain wentworth in the case  was not worth enquiry  for there was a captain wentworth  and be the conclusion of the present suspense good or bad  her affection would be his for ever .', 'their union  she believed  could not divide her more from other men  than their final separation .', 'prettier musings of high  wrought love and eternal constancy  could never have passed along the streets of bath  than anne was sporting with from camden place to westgate buildings .', 'it was almost enough to spread purification and perfume all the way .', 'she was sure of a pleasant reception  and her friend seemed this morning particularly obliged to her for coming  seemed hardly to have expected her  though it had been an appointment .', 'an account of the concert was immediately claimed  and anne  s recollections of the concert were quite happy enough to animate her features and make her rejoice to talk of it .', 'all that she could tell she told most gladly  but the all was little for one who had been there  and unsatisfactory for such an enquirer as mrs smith  who had already heard  through the short cut of a laundress and a waiter  rather more of the general success and produce of the evening than anne could relate  and who now asked in vain for several particulars of the company .', 'everybody of any consequence or notoriety in bath was well know by name to mrs smith .', ' the little durands were there  i conclude  said she   with their mouths open to catch the music  like unfledged sparrows ready to be fed .', 'they never miss a concert .', ' yes  i did not see them myself  but i heard mr elliot say they were in the room .', ' the ibbotsons  were they there ', 'and the two new beauties  with the tall irish officer  who is talked of for one of them .', ' i do not know .', 'i do not think they were .', ' old lady mary maclean ', 'i need not ask after her .', 'she never misses  i know  and you must have seen her .', 'she must have been in your own circle  for as you went with lady dalrymple  you were in the seats of grandeur  round the orchestra  of course .', ' no  that was what i dreaded .', 'it would have been very unpleasant to me in every respect .', 'but happily lady dalrymple always chooses to be farther off  and we were exceedingly well placed  that is  for hearing  i must not say for seeing  because i appear to have seen very little .', ' oh ', 'you saw enough for your own amusement .', 'i can understand .', 'there is a sort of domestic enjoyment to be known even in a crowd  and this you had .', 'you were a large party in yourselves  and you wanted nothing beyond .', ' but i ought to have looked about me more  said anne  conscious while she spoke that there had in fact been no want of looking about  that the object only had been deficient .', ' no  no  you were better employed .', 'you need not tell me that you had a pleasant evening .', 'i see it in your eye .', 'i perfectly see how the hours passed  that you had always something agreeable to listen to .', 'in the intervals of the concert it was conversation .', 'anne half smiled and said   do you see that in my eye ', ' yes  i do .', 'your countenance perfectly informs me that you were in company last night with the person whom you think the most agreeable in the world  the person who interests you at this present time more than all the rest of the world put together .', 'a blush overspread anne  s cheeks .', 'she could say nothing .', ' and such being the case  continued mrs smith  after a short pause   i hope you believe that i do know how to value your kindness in coming to me this morning .', 'it is really very good of you to come and sit with me  when you must have so many pleasanter demands upon your time .', 'anne heard nothing of this .', 'she was still in the astonishment and confusion excited by her friend  s penetration  unable to imagine how any report of captain wentworth could have reached her .', 'after another short silence ', ' pray  said mrs smith   is mr elliot aware of your acquaintance with me ', 'does he know that i am in bath ', ' mr elliot ', 'repeated anne  looking up surprised .', 'a moment  s reflection shewed her the mistake she had been under .', 'she caught it instantaneously  and recovering her courage with the feeling of safety  soon added  more composedly   are you acquainted with mr elliot ', ' i have been a good deal acquainted with him  replied mrs smith  gravely   but it seems worn out now .', 'it is a great while since we met .', ' i was not at all aware of this .', 'you never mentioned it before .', 'had i known it  i would have had the pleasure of talking to him about you .', ' to confess the truth  said mrs smith  assuming her usual air of cheerfulness   that is exactly the pleasure i want you to have .', 'i want you to talk about me to mr elliot .', 'i want your interest with him .', 'he can be of essential service to me  and if you would have the goodness  my dear miss elliot  to make it an object to yourself  of course it is done .', ' i should be extremely happy  i hope you cannot doubt my willingness to be of even the slightest use to you  replied anne   but i suspect that you are considering me as having a higher claim on mr elliot  a greater right to influence him  than is really the case .', 'i am sure you have  somehow or other  imbibed such a notion .', 'you must consider me only as mr elliot  s relation .', 'if in that light there is anything which you suppose his cousin might fairly ask of him  i beg you would not hesitate to employ me .', 'mrs smith gave her a penetrating glance  and then  smiling  said ', ' i have been a little premature  i perceive  i beg your pardon .', 'i ought to have waited for official information  but now  my dear miss elliot  as an old friend  do give me a hint as to when i may speak .', 'next week ', 'to be sure by next week i may be allowed to think it all settled  and build my own selfish schemes on mr elliot  s good fortune .', ' no  replied anne   nor next week  nor next  nor next .', 'i assure you that nothing of the sort you are thinking of will be settled any week .', 'i am not going to marry mr elliot .', 'i should like to know why you imagine i am ', 'mrs smith looked at her again  looked earnestly  smiled  shook her head  and exclaimed ', ' now  how i do wish i understood you ', 'how i do wish i knew what you were at ', 'i have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel  when the right moment occurs .', 'till it does come  you know  we women never mean to have anybody .', 'it is a thing of course among us  that every man is refused  till he offers .', 'but why should you be cruel ', 'let me plead for my  present friend i cannot call him  but for my former friend .', 'where can you look for a more suitable match ', 'where could you expect a more gentlemanlike  agreeable man ', 'let me recommend mr elliot .', 'i am sure you hear nothing but good of him from colonel wallis  and who can know him better than colonel wallis ', ' my dear mrs smith  mr elliot  s wife has not been dead much above half a year .', 'he ought not to be supposed to be paying his addresses to any one .', ' oh ', 'if these are your only objections  cried mrs smith  archly   mr elliot is safe  and i shall give myself no more trouble about him .', 'do not forget me when you are married  that  s all .', 'let him know me to be a friend of yours  and then he will think little of the trouble required  which it is very natural for him now  with so many affairs and engagements of his own  to avoid and get rid of as he can  very natural  perhaps .', 'ninety  nine out of a hundred would do the same .', 'of course  he cannot be aware of the importance to me .', 'well  my dear miss elliot  i hope and trust you will be very happy .', 'mr elliot has sense to understand the value of such a woman .', 'your peace will not be shipwrecked as mine has been .', 'you are safe in all worldly matters  and safe in his character .', 'he will not be led astray  he will not be misled by others to his ruin .', ' no  said anne   i can readily believe all that of my cousin .', 'he seems to have a calm decided temper  not at all open to dangerous impressions .', 'i consider him with great respect .', 'i have no reason  from any thing that has fallen within my observation  to do otherwise .', 'but i have not known him long  and he is not a man  i think  to be known intimately soon .', 'will not this manner of speaking of him  mrs smith  convince you that he is nothing to me ', 'surely this must be calm enough .', 'and  upon my word  he is nothing to me .', 'should he ever propose to me  which i have very little reason to imagine he has any thought of doing  i shall not accept him .', 'i assure you i shall not .', 'i assure you  mr elliot had not the share which you have been supposing  in whatever pleasure the concert of last night might afford  not mr elliot  it is not mr elliot that ', 'she stopped  regretting with a deep blush that she had implied so much  but less would hardly have been sufficient .', 'mrs smith would hardly have believed so soon in mr elliot  s failure  but from the perception of there being a somebody else .', 'as it was  she instantly submitted  and with all the semblance of seeing nothing beyond  and anne  eager to escape farther notice  was impatient to know why mrs smith should have fancied she was to marry mr elliot  where she could have received the idea  or from whom she could have heard it .', ' do tell me how it first came into your head .', ' it first came into my head  replied mrs smith   upon finding how much you were together  and feeling it to be the most probable thing in the world to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you  and you may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of you in the same way .', 'but i never heard it spoken of till two days ago .', ' and has it indeed been spoken of ', ' did you observe the woman who opened the door to you when you called yesterday ', ' no .', 'was not it mrs speed  as usual  or the maid ', 'i observed no one in particular .', ' it was my friend mrs rooke  nurse rooke  who  by  the  bye  had a great curiosity to see you  and was delighted to be in the way to let you in .', 'she came away from marlborough buildings only on sunday  and she it was who told me you were to marry mr elliot .', 'she had had it from mrs wallis herself  which did not seem bad authority .', 'she sat an hour with me on monday evening  and gave me the whole history .', ' the whole history  repeated anne  laughing .', ' she could not make a very long history  i think  of one such little article of unfounded news .', 'mrs smith said nothing .', ' but  continued anne  presently   though there is no truth in my having this claim on mr elliot  i should be extremely happy to be of use to you in any way that i could .', 'shall i mention to him your being in bath ', 'shall i take any message ', ' no  i thank you  no  certainly not .', 'in the warmth of the moment  and under a mistaken impression  i might  perhaps  have endeavoured to interest you in some circumstances  but not now .', 'no  i thank you  i have nothing to trouble you with .', ' i think you spoke of having known mr elliot many years ', ' i did .', ' not before he was married  i suppose ', ' yes  he was not married when i knew him first .', ' and  were you much acquainted ', ' intimately .', ' indeed ', 'then do tell me what he was at that time of life .', 'i have a great curiosity to know what mr elliot was as a very young man .', 'was he at all such as he appears now ', ' i have not seen mr elliot these three years  was mrs smith  s answer  given so gravely that it was impossible to pursue the subject farther  and anne felt that she had gained nothing but an increase of curiosity .', 'they were both silent  mrs smith very thoughtful .', 'at last ', ' i beg your pardon  my dear miss elliot  she cried  in her natural tone of cordiality   i beg your pardon for the short answers i have been giving you  but i have been uncertain what i ought to do .', 'i have been doubting and considering as to what i ought to tell you .', 'there were many things to be taken into the account .', 'one hates to be officious  to be giving bad impressions  making mischief .', 'even the smooth surface of family  union seems worth preserving  though there may be nothing durable beneath .', 'however  i have determined  i think i am right  i think you ought to be made acquainted with mr elliot  s real character .', 'though i fully believe that  at present  you have not the smallest intention of accepting him  there is no saying what may happen .', 'you might  some time or other  be differently affected towards him .', 'hear the truth  therefore  now  while you are unprejudiced .', 'mr elliot is a man without heart or conscience  a designing  wary  cold  blooded being  who thinks only of himself  whom for his own interest or ease  would be guilty of any cruelty  or any treachery  that could be perpetrated without risk of his general character .', 'he has no feeling for others .', 'those whom he has been the chief cause of leading into ruin  he can neglect and desert without the smallest compunction .', 'he is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of justice or compassion .', 'oh ', 'he is black at heart  hollow and black ', 'anne  s astonished air  and exclamation of wonder  made her pause  and in a calmer manner  she added ', ' my expressions startle you .', 'you must allow for an injured  angry woman .', 'but i will try to command myself .', 'i will not abuse him .', 'i will only tell you what i have found him .', 'facts shall speak .', 'he was the intimate friend of my dear husband  who trusted and loved him  and thought him as good as himself .', 'the intimacy had been formed before our marriage .', 'i found them most intimate friends  and i  too  became excessively pleased with mr elliot  and entertained the highest opinion of him .', 'at nineteen  you know  one does not think very seriously  but mr elliot appeared to me quite as good as others  and much more agreeable than most others  and we were almost always together .', 'we were principally in town  living in very good style .', 'he was then the inferior in circumstances  he was then the poor one  he had chambers in the temple  and it was as much as he could do to support the appearance of a gentleman .', 'he had always a home with us whenever he chose it  he was always welcome  he was like a brother .', 'my poor charles  who had the finest  most generous spirit in the world  would have divided his last farthing with him  and i know that his purse was open to him  i know that he often assisted him .', ' this must have been about that very period of mr elliot  s life  said anne   which has always excited my particular curiosity .', 'it must have been about the same time that he became known to my father and sister .', 'i never knew him myself  i only heard of him  but there was a something in his conduct then  with regard to my father and sister  and afterwards in the circumstances of his marriage  which i never could quite reconcile with present times .', 'it seemed to announce a different sort of man .', ' i know it all  i know it all  cried mrs smith .', ' he had been introduced to sir walter and your sister before i was acquainted with him  but i heard him speak of them for ever .', 'i know he was invited and encouraged  and i know he did not choose to go .', 'i can satisfy you  perhaps  on points which you would little expect  and as to his marriage  i knew all about it at the time .', 'i was privy to all the fors and againsts  i was the friend to whom he confided his hopes and plans  and though i did not know his wife previously  her inferior situation in society  indeed  rendered that impossible  yet i knew her all her life afterwards  or at least till within the last two years of her life  and can answer any question you may wish to put .', ' nay  said anne   i have no particular enquiry to make about her .', 'i have always understood they were not a happy couple .', 'but i should like to know why  at that time of his life  he should slight my father  s acquaintance as he did .', 'my father was certainly disposed to take very kind and proper notice of him .', 'why did mr elliot draw back ', ' mr elliot  replied mrs smith   at that period of his life  had one object in view  to make his fortune  and by a rather quicker process than the law .', 'he was determined to make it by marriage .', 'he was determined  at least  not to mar it by an imprudent marriage  and i know it was his belief  whether justly or not  of course i cannot decide  that your father and sister  in their civilities and invitations  were designing a match between the heir and the young lady  and it was impossible that such a match should have answered his ideas of wealth and independence .', 'that was his motive for drawing back  i can assure you .', 'he told me the whole story .', 'he had no concealments with me .', 'it was curious  that having just left you behind me in bath  my first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be your cousin  and that  through him  i should be continually hearing of your father and sister .', 'he described one miss elliot  and i thought very affectionately of the other .', ' perhaps  cried anne  struck by a sudden idea   you sometimes spoke of me to mr elliot ', ' to be sure i did  very often .', 'i used to boast of my own anne elliot  and vouch for your being a very different creature from ', 'she checked herself just in time .', ' this accounts for something which mr elliot said last night  cried anne .', ' this explains it .', 'i found he had been used to hear of me .', 'i could not comprehend how .', 'what wild imaginations one forms where dear self is concerned ', 'how sure to be mistaken ', 'but i beg your pardon  i have interrupted you .', 'mr elliot married then completely for money ', 'the circumstances  probably  which first opened your eyes to his character .', 'mrs smith hesitated a little here .', ' oh ', 'those things are too common .', 'when one lives in the world  a man or woman  s marrying for money is too common to strike one as it ought .', 'i was very young  and associated only with the young  and we were a thoughtless  gay set  without any strict rules of conduct .', 'we lived for enjoyment .', 'i think differently now  time and sickness and sorrow have given me other notions  but at that period i must own i saw nothing reprehensible in what mr elliot was doing .', ' to do the best for himself  passed as a duty .', ' but was not she a very low woman ', ' yes  which i objected to  but he would not regard .', 'money  money  was all that he wanted .', 'her father was a grazier  her grandfather had been a butcher  but that was all nothing .', 'she was a fine woman  had had a decent education  was brought forward by some cousins  thrown by chance into mr elliot  s company  and fell in love with him  and not a difficulty or a scruple was there on his side  with respect to her birth .', 'all his caution was spent in being secured of the real amount of her fortune  before he committed himself .', 'depend upon it  whatever esteem mr elliot may have for his own situation in life now  as a young man he had not the smallest value for it .', 'his chance for the kellynch estate was something  but all the honour of the family he held as cheap as dirt .', 'i have often heard him declare  that if baronetcies were saleable  anybody should have his for fifty pounds  arms and motto  name and livery included  but i will not pretend to repeat half that i used to hear him say on that subject .', 'it would not be fair  and yet you ought to have proof  for what is all this but assertion  and you shall have proof .', ' indeed  my dear mrs smith  i want none  cried anne .', ' you have asserted nothing contradictory to what mr elliot appeared to be some years ago .', 'this is all in confirmation  rather  of what we used to hear and believe .', 'i am more curious to know why he should be so different now .', ' but for my satisfaction  if you will have the goodness to ring for mary  stay  i am sure you will have the still greater goodness of going yourself into my bedroom  and bringing me the small inlaid box which you will find on the upper shelf of the closet .', 'anne  seeing her friend to be earnestly bent on it  did as she was desired .', 'the box was brought and placed before her  and mrs smith  sighing over it as she unlocked it  said ', ' this is full of papers belonging to him  to my husband  a small portion only of what i had to look over when i lost him .', 'the letter i am looking for was one written by mr elliot to him before our marriage  and happened to be saved  why  one can hardly imagine .', 'but he was careless and immethodical  like other men  about those things  and when i came to examine his papers  i found it with others still more trivial  from different people scattered here and there  while many letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed .', 'here it is  i would not burn it  because being even then very little satisfied with mr elliot  i was determined to preserve every document of former intimacy .', 'i have now another motive for being glad that i can produce it .', 'this was the letter  directed to  charles smith  esq .', 'tunbridge wells  and dated from london  as far back as july    ', ' dear smith  i have received yours .', 'your kindness almost overpowers me .', 'i wish nature had made such hearts as yours more common  but i have lived three  and  twenty years in the world  and have seen none like it .', 'at present  believe me  i have no need of your services  being in cash again .', 'give me joy  i have got rid of sir walter and miss .', 'they are gone back to kellynch  and almost made me swear to visit them this summer  but my first visit to kellynch will be with a surveyor  to tell me how to bring it with best advantage to the hammer .', 'the baronet  nevertheless  is not unlikely to marry again  he is quite fool enough .', 'if he does  however  they will leave me in peace  which may be a decent equivalent for the reversion .', 'he is worse than last year .', ' i wish i had any name but elliot .', 'i am sick of it .', 'the name of walter i can drop  thank god ', 'and i desire you will never insult me with my second w . again  meaning  for the rest of my life  to be only yours truly  wm .', 'elliot .', 'such a letter could not be read without putting anne in a glow  and mrs smith  observing the high colour in her face  said ', ' the language  i know  is highly disrespectful .', 'though i have forgot the exact terms  i have a perfect impression of the general meaning .', 'but it shows you the man .', 'mark his professions to my poor husband .', 'can any thing be stronger ', 'anne could not immediately get over the shock and mortification of finding such words applied to her father .', 'she was obliged to recollect that her seeing the letter was a violation of the laws of honour  that no one ought to be judged or to be known by such testimonies  that no private correspondence could bear the eye of others  before she could recover calmness enough to return the letter which she had been meditating over  and say ', ' thank you .', 'this is full proof undoubtedly  proof of every thing you were saying .', 'but why be acquainted with us now ', ' i can explain this too  cried mrs smith  smiling .', ' can you really ', ' yes .', 'i have shewn you mr elliot as he was a dozen years ago  and i will shew him as he is now .', 'i cannot produce written proof again  but i can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire  of what he is now wanting  and what he is now doing .', 'he is no hypocrite now .', 'he truly wants to marry you .', 'his present attentions to your family are very sincere  quite from the heart .', 'i will give you my authority  his friend colonel wallis .', ' colonel wallis ', 'you are acquainted with him ', ' no .', 'it does not come to me in quite so direct a line as that  it takes a bend or two  but nothing of consequence .', 'the stream is as good as at first  the little rubbish it collects in the turnings is easily moved away .', 'mr elliot talks unreservedly to colonel wallis of his views on you  which said colonel wallis  i imagine to be  in himself  a sensible  careful  discerning sort of character  but colonel wallis has a very pretty silly wife  to whom he tells things which he had better not  and he repeats it all to her .', 'she in the overflowing spirits of her recovery  repeats it all to her nurse  and the nurse knowing my acquaintance with you  very naturally brings it all to me .', 'on monday evening  my good friend mrs rooke let me thus much into the secrets of marlborough buildings .', 'when i talked of a whole history  therefore  you see i was not romancing so much as you supposed .', ' my dear mrs smith  your authority is deficient .', 'this will not do .', 'mr elliot  s having any views on me will not in the least account for the efforts he made towards a reconciliation with my father .', 'that was all prior to my coming to bath .', 'i found them on the most friendly terms when i arrived .', ' i know you did  i know it all perfectly  but ', ' indeed  mrs smith  we must not expect to get real information in such a line .', 'facts or opinions which are to pass through the hands of so many  to be misconceived by folly in one  and ignorance in another  can hardly have much truth left .', ' only give me a hearing .', 'you will soon be able to judge of the general credit due  by listening to some particulars which you can yourself immediately contradict or confirm .', 'nobody supposes that you were his first inducement .', 'he had seen you indeed  before he came to bath  and admired you  but without knowing it to be you .', 'so says my historian  at least .', 'is this true ', 'did he see you last summer or autumn   somewhere down in the west  to use her own words  without knowing it to be you ', ' he certainly did .', 'so far it is very true .', 'at lyme .', 'i happened to be at lyme .', ' well  continued mrs smith  triumphantly   grant my friend the credit due to the establishment of the first point asserted .', 'he saw you then at lyme  and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased to meet with you again in camden place  as miss anne elliot  and from that moment  i have no doubt  had a double motive in his visits there .', 'but there was another  and an earlier  which i will now explain .', 'if there is anything in my story which you know to be either false or improbable  stop me .', 'my account states  that your sister  s friend  the lady now staying with you  whom i have heard you mention  came to bath with miss elliot and sir walter as long ago as september  in short when they first came themselves  and has been staying there ever since  that she is a clever  insinuating  handsome woman  poor and plausible  and altogether such in situation and manner  as to give a general idea  among sir walter  s acquaintance  of her meaning to be lady elliot  and as general a surprise that miss elliot should be apparently  blind to the danger .', 'here mrs smith paused a moment  but anne had not a word to say  and she continued ', ' this was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family  long before you returned to it  and colonel wallis had his eye upon your father enough to be sensible of it  though he did not then visit in camden place  but his regard for mr elliot gave him an interest in watching all that was going on there  and when mr elliot came to bath for a day or two  as he happened to do a little before christmas  colonel wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things  and the reports beginning to prevail .', 'now you are to understand  that time had worked a very material change in mr elliot  s opinions as to the value of a baronetcy .', 'upon all points of blood and connexion he is a completely altered man .', 'having long had as much money as he could spend  nothing to wish for on the side of avarice or indulgence  he has been gradually learning to pin his happiness upon the consequence he is heir to .', 'i thought it coming on before our acquaintance ceased  but it is now a confirmed feeling .', 'he cannot bear the idea of not being sir william .', 'you may guess  therefore  that the news he heard from his friend could not be very agreeable  and you may guess what it produced  the resolution of coming back to bath as soon as possible  and of fixing himself here for a time  with the view of renewing his former acquaintance  and recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means of ascertaining the degree of his danger  and of circumventing the lady if he found it material .', 'this was agreed upon between the two friends as the only thing to be done  and colonel wallis was to assist in every way that he could .', 'he was to be introduced  and mrs wallis was to be introduced  and everybody was to be introduced .', 'mr elliot came back accordingly  and on application was forgiven  as you know  and re  admitted into the family  and there it was his constant object  and his only object  till your arrival added another motive  to watch sir walter and mrs clay .', 'he omitted no opportunity of being with them  threw himself in their way  called at all hours  but i need not be particular on this subject .', 'you can imagine what an artful man would do  and with this guide  perhaps  may recollect what you have seen him do .', ' yes  said anne   you tell me nothing which does not accord with what i have known  or could imagine .', 'there is always something offensive in the details of cunning .', 'the manoeuvres of selfishness and duplicity must ever be revolting  but i have heard nothing which really surprises me .', 'i know those who would be shocked by such a representation of mr elliot  who would have difficulty in believing it  but i have never been satisfied .', 'i have always wanted some other motive for his conduct than appeared .', 'i should like to know his present opinion  as to the probability of the event he has been in dread of  whether he considers the danger to be lessening or not .', ' lessening  i understand  replied mrs smith .', ' he thinks mrs clay afraid of him  aware that he sees through her  and not daring to proceed as she might do in his absence .', 'but since he must be absent some time or other  i do not perceive how he can ever be secure while she holds her present influence .', 'mrs wallis has an amusing idea  as nurse tells me  that it is to be put into the marriage articles when you and mr elliot marry  that your father is not to marry mrs clay .', 'a scheme  worthy of mrs wallis  s understanding  by all accounts  but my sensible nurse rooke sees the absurdity of it .', ' why  to be sure  ma  am  said she   it would not prevent his marrying anybody else .', 'and  indeed  to own the truth  i do not think nurse  in her heart  is a very strenuous opposer of sir walter  s making a second match .', 'she must be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony  you know  and  since self will intrude  who can say that she may not have some flying visions of attending the next lady elliot  through mrs wallis  s recommendation ', ' i am very glad to know all this  said anne  after a little thoughtfulness .', ' it will be more painful to me in some respects to be in company with him  but i shall know better what to do .', 'my line of conduct will be more direct .', 'mr elliot is evidently a disingenuous  artificial  worldly man  who has never had any better principle to guide him than selfishness .', 'but mr elliot was not done with .', 'mrs smith had been carried away from her first direction  and anne had forgotten  in the interest of her own family concerns  how much had been originally implied against him  but her attention was now called to the explanation of those first hints  and she listened to a recital which  if it did not perfectly justify the unqualified bitterness of mrs smith  proved him to have been very unfeeling in his conduct towards her  very deficient both in justice and compassion .', 'she learned that  the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired by mr elliot  s marriage  they had been as before always together  and mr elliot had led his friend into expenses much beyond his fortune .', 'mrs smith did not want to take blame to herself  and was most tender of throwing any on her husband  but anne could collect that their income had never been equal to their style of living  and that from the first there had been a great deal of general and joint extravagance .', 'from his wife  s account of him she could discern mr smith to have been a man of warm feelings  easy temper  careless habits  and not strong understanding  much more amiable than his friend  and very unlike him  led by him  and probably despised by him .', 'mr elliot  raised by his marriage to great affluence  and disposed to every gratification of pleasure and vanity which could be commanded without involving himself   for with all his self  indulgence he had become a prudent man  and beginning to be rich  just as his friend ought to have found himself to be poor  seemed to have had no concern at all for that friend  s probable finances  but  on the contrary  had been prompting and encouraging expenses which could end only in ruin  and the smiths accordingly had been ruined .', 'the husband had died just in time to be spared the full knowledge of it .', 'they had previously known embarrassments enough to try the friendship of their friends  and to prove that mr elliot  s had better not be tried  but it was not till his death that the wretched state of his affairs was fully known .', 'with a confidence in mr elliot  s regard  more creditable to his feelings than his judgement  mr smith had appointed him the executor of his will  but mr elliot would not act  and the difficulties and distress which this refusal had heaped on her  in addition to the inevitable sufferings of her situation  had been such as could not be related without anguish of spirit  or listened to without corresponding indignation .', 'anne was shewn some letters of his on the occasion  answers to urgent applications from mrs smith  which all breathed the same stern resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble  and  under a cold civility  the same hard  hearted indifference to any of the evils it might bring on her .', 'it was a dreadful picture of ingratitude and inhumanity  and anne felt  at some moments  that no flagrant open crime could have been worse .', 'she had a great deal to listen to  all the particulars of past sad scenes  all the minutiae of distress upon distress  which in former conversations had been merely hinted at  were dwelt on now with a natural indulgence .', 'anne could perfectly comprehend the exquisite relief  and was only the more inclined to wonder at the composure of her friend  s usual state of mind .', 'there was one circumstance in the history of her grievances of particular irritation .', 'she had good reason to believe that some property of her husband in the west indies  which had been for many years under a sort of sequestration for the payment of its own incumbrances  might be recoverable by proper measures  and this property  though not large  would be enough to make her comparatively rich .', 'but there was nobody to stir in it .', 'mr elliot would do nothing  and she could do nothing herself  equally disabled from personal exertion by her state of bodily weakness  and from employing others by her want of money .', 'she had no natural connexions to assist her even with their counsel  and she could not afford to purchase the assistance of the law .', 'this was a cruel aggravation of actually straitened means .', 'to feel that she ought to be in better circumstances  that a little trouble in the right place might do it  and to fear that delay might be even weakening her claims  was hard to bear .', 'it was on this point that she had hoped to engage anne  s good offices with mr elliot .', 'she had previously  in the anticipation of their marriage  been very apprehensive of losing her friend by it  but on being assured that he could have made no attempt of that nature  since he did not even know her to be in bath  it immediately occurred  that something might be done in her favour by the influence of the woman he loved  and she had been hastily preparing to interest anne  s feelings  as far as the observances due to mr elliot  s character would allow  when anne  s refutation of the supposed engagement changed the face of everything  and while it took from her the new  formed hope of succeeding in the object of her first anxiety  left her at least the comfort of telling the whole story her own way .', 'after listening to this full description of mr elliot  anne could not but express some surprise at mrs smith  s having spoken of him so favourably in the beginning of their conversation .', ' she had seemed to recommend and praise him ', ' my dear  was mrs smith  s reply   there was nothing else to be done .', 'i considered your marrying him as certain  though he might not yet have made the offer  and i could no more speak the truth of him  than if he had been your husband .', 'my heart bled for you  as i talked of happiness  and yet he is sensible  he is agreeable  and with such a woman as you  it was not absolutely hopeless .', 'he was very unkind to his first wife .', 'they were wretched together .', 'but she was too ignorant and giddy for respect  and he had never loved her .', 'i was willing to hope that you must fare better .', 'anne could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility of having been induced to marry him  as made her shudder at the idea of the misery which must have followed .', 'it was just possible that she might have been persuaded by lady russell ', 'and under such a supposition  which would have been most miserable  when time had disclosed all  too late ', 'it was very desirable that lady russell should be no longer deceived  and one of the concluding arrangements of this important conference  which carried them through the greater part of the morning  was  that anne had full liberty to communicate to her friend everything relative to mrs smith  in which his conduct was involved .', 'chapter ', 'anne went home to think over all that she had heard .', 'in one point  her feelings were relieved by this knowledge of mr elliot .', 'there was no longer anything of tenderness due to him .', 'he stood as opposed to captain wentworth  in all his own unwelcome obtrusiveness  and the evil of his attentions last night  the irremediable mischief he might have done  was considered with sensations unqualified  unperplexed .', 'pity for him was all over .', 'but this was the only point of relief .', 'in every other respect  in looking around her  or penetrating forward  she saw more to distrust and to apprehend .', 'she was concerned for the disappointment and pain lady russell would be feeling  for the mortifications which must be hanging over her father and sister  and had all the distress of foreseeing many evils  without knowing how to avert any one of them .', 'she was most thankful for her own knowledge of him .', 'she had never considered herself as entitled to reward for not slighting an old friend like mrs smith  but here was a reward indeed springing from it ', 'mrs smith had been able to tell her what no one else could have done .', 'could the knowledge have been extended through her family ', 'but this was a vain idea .', 'she must talk to lady russell  tell her  consult with her  and having done her best  wait the event with as much composure as possible  and after all  her greatest want of composure would be in that quarter of the mind which could not be opened to lady russell  in that flow of anxieties and fears which must be all to herself .', 'she found  on reaching home  that she had  as she intended  escaped seeing mr elliot  that he had called and paid them a long morning visit  but hardly had she congratulated herself  and felt safe  when she heard that he was coming again in the evening .', ' i had not the smallest intention of asking him  said elizabeth  with affected carelessness   but he gave so many hints  so mrs clay says  at least .', ' indeed  i do say it .', 'i never saw anybody in my life spell harder for an invitation .', 'poor man ', 'i was really in pain for him  for your hard  hearted sister  miss anne  seems bent on cruelty .', ' oh ', 'cried elizabeth   i have been rather too much used to the game to be soon overcome by a gentleman  s hints .', 'however  when i found how excessively he was regretting that he should miss my father this morning  i gave way immediately  for i would never really omit an opportunity of bring him and sir walter together .', 'they appear to so much advantage in company with each other .', 'each behaving so pleasantly .', 'mr elliot looking up with so much respect .', ' quite delightful ', 'cried mrs clay  not daring  however  to turn her eyes towards anne .', ' exactly like father and son ', 'dear miss elliot  may i not say father and son ', ' oh ', 'i lay no embargo on any body  s words .', 'if you will have such ideas ', 'but  upon my word  i am scarcely sensible of his attentions being beyond those of other men .', ' my dear miss elliot ', 'exclaimed mrs clay  lifting her hands and eyes  and sinking all the rest of her astonishment in a convenient silence .', ' well  my dear penelope  you need not be so alarmed about him .', 'i did invite him  you know .', 'i sent him away with smiles .', 'when i found he was really going to his friends at thornberry park for the whole day to  morrow  i had compassion on him .', 'anne admired the good acting of the friend  in being able to shew such pleasure as she did  in the expectation and in the actual arrival of the very person whose presence must really be interfering with her prime object .', 'it was impossible but that mrs clay must hate the sight of mr elliot  and yet she could assume a most obliging  placid look  and appear quite satisfied with the curtailed license of devoting herself only half as much to sir walter as she would have done otherwise .', 'to anne herself it was most distressing to see mr elliot enter the room  and quite painful to have him approach and speak to her .', 'she had been used before to feel that he could not be always quite sincere  but now she saw insincerity in everything .', 'his attentive deference to her father  contrasted with his former language  was odious  and when she thought of his cruel conduct towards mrs smith  she could hardly bear the sight of his present smiles and mildness  or the sound of his artificial good sentiments .', 'she meant to avoid any such alteration of manners as might provoke a remonstrance on his side .', 'it was a great object to her to escape all enquiry or eclat  but it was her intention to be as decidedly cool to him as might be compatible with their relationship  and to retrace  as quietly as she could  the few steps of unnecessary intimacy she had been gradually led along .', 'she was accordingly more guarded  and more cool  than she had been the night before .', 'he wanted to animate her curiosity again as to how and where he could have heard her formerly praised  wanted very much to be gratified by more solicitation  but the charm was broken  he found that the heat and animation of a public room was necessary to kindle his modest cousin  s vanity  he found  at least  that it was not to be done now  by any of those attempts which he could hazard among the too  commanding claims of the others .', 'he little surmised that it was a subject acting now exactly against his interest  bringing immediately to her thoughts all those parts of his conduct which were least excusable .', 'she had some satisfaction in finding that he was really going out of bath the next morning  going early  and that he would be gone the greater part of two days .', 'he was invited again to camden place the very evening of his return  but from thursday to saturday evening his absence was certain .', 'it was bad enough that a mrs clay should be always before her  but that a deeper hypocrite should be added to their party  seemed the destruction of everything like peace and comfort .', 'it was so humiliating to reflect on the constant deception practised on her father and elizabeth  to consider the various sources of mortification preparing for them ', 'mrs clay  s selfishness was not so complicate nor so revolting as his  and anne would have compounded for the marriage at once  with all its evils  to be clear of mr elliot  s subtleties in endeavouring to prevent it .', 'on friday morning she meant to go very early to lady russell  and accomplish the necessary communication  and she would have gone directly after breakfast  but that mrs clay was also going out on some obliging purpose of saving her sister trouble  which determined her to wait till she might be safe from such a companion .', 'she saw mrs clay fairly off  therefore  before she began to talk of spending the morning in rivers street .', ' very well  said elizabeth   i have nothing to send but my love .', 'oh ', 'you may as well take back that tiresome book she would lend me  and pretend i have read it through .', 'i really cannot be plaguing myself for ever with all the new poems and states of the nation that come out .', 'lady russell quite bores one with her new publications .', 'you need not tell her so  but i thought her dress hideous the other night .', 'i used to think she had some taste in dress  but i was ashamed of her at the concert .', 'something so formal and arrange in her air ', 'and she sits so upright ', 'my best love  of course .', ' and mine  added sir walter .', ' kindest regards .', 'and you may say  that i mean to call upon her soon .', 'make a civil message  but i shall only leave my card .', 'morning visits are never fair by women at her time of life  who make themselves up so little .', 'if she would only wear rouge she would not be afraid of being seen  but last time i called  i observed the blinds were let down immediately .', 'while her father spoke  there was a knock at the door .', 'who could it be ', 'anne  remembering the preconcerted visits  at all hours  of mr elliot  would have expected him  but for his known engagement seven miles off .', 'after the usual period of suspense  the usual sounds of approach were heard  and  mr and mrs charles musgrove  were ushered into the room .', 'surprise was the strongest emotion raised by their appearance  but anne was really glad to see them  and the others were not so sorry but that they could put on a decent air of welcome  and as soon as it became clear that these  their nearest relations  were not arrived with an views of accommodation in that house  sir walter and elizabeth were able to rise in cordiality  and do the honours of it very well .', 'they were come to bath for a few days with mrs musgrove  and were at the white hart .', 'so much was pretty soon understood  but till sir walter and elizabeth were walking mary into the other drawing  room  and regaling themselves with her admiration  anne could not draw upon charles  s brain for a regular history of their coming  or an explanation of some smiling hints of particular business  which had been ostentatiously dropped by mary  as well as of some apparent confusion as to whom their party consisted of .', 'she then found that it consisted of mrs musgrove  henrietta  and captain harville  beside their two selves .', 'he gave her a very plain  intelligible account of the whole  a narration in which she saw a great deal of most characteristic proceeding .', 'the scheme had received its first impulse by captain harville  s wanting to come to bath on business .', 'he had begun to talk of it a week ago  and by way of doing something  as shooting was over  charles had proposed coming with him  and mrs harville had seemed to like the idea of it very much  as an advantage to her husband  but mary could not bear to be left  and had made herself so unhappy about it  that for a day or two everything seemed to be in suspense  or at an end .', 'but then  it had been taken up by his father and mother .', 'his mother had some old friends in bath whom she wanted to see  it was thought a good opportunity for henrietta to come and buy wedding  clothes for herself and her sister  and  in short  it ended in being his mother  s party  that everything might be comfortable and easy to captain harville  and he and mary were included in it by way of general convenience .', 'they had arrived late the night before .', 'mrs harville  her children  and captain benwick  remained with mr musgrove and louisa at uppercross .', 'anne  s only surprise was  that affairs should be in forwardness enough for henrietta  s wedding  clothes to be talked of .', 'she had imagined such difficulties of fortune to exist there as must prevent the marriage from being near at hand  but she learned from charles that  very recently   since mary  s last letter to herself  charles hayter had been applied to by a friend to hold a living for a youth who could not possibly claim it under many years  and that on the strength of his present income  with almost a certainty of something more permanent long before the term in question  the two families had consented to the young people  s wishes  and that their marriage was likely to take place in a few months  quite as soon as louisa  s .', ' and a very good living it was  charles added   only five  and  twenty miles from uppercross  and in a very fine country  fine part of dorsetshire .', 'in the centre of some of the best preserves in the kingdom  surrounded by three great proprietors  each more careful and jealous than the other  and to two of the three at least  charles hayter might get a special recommendation .', 'not that he will value it as he ought  he observed   charles is too cool about sporting .', 'that  s the worst of him .', ' i am extremely glad  indeed  cried anne   particularly glad that this should happen  and that of two sisters  who both deserve equally well  and who have always been such good friends  the pleasant prospect of one should not be dimming those of the other  that they should be so equal in their prosperity and comfort .', 'i hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both .', ' oh ', 'yes .', 'my father would be well pleased if the gentlemen were richer  but he has no other fault to find .', 'money  you know  coming down with money  two daughters at once  it cannot be a very agreeable operation  and it streightens him as to many things .', 'however  i do not mean to say they have not a right to it .', 'it is very fit they should have daughters  shares  and i am sure he has always been a very kind  liberal father to me .', 'mary does not above half like henrietta  s match .', 'she never did  you know .', 'but she does not do him justice  nor think enough about winthrop .', 'i cannot make her attend to the value of the property .', 'it is a very fair match  as times go  and i have liked charles hayter all my life  and i shall not leave off now .', ' such excellent parents as mr and mrs musgrove  exclaimed anne   should be happy in their children  s marriages .', 'they do everything to confer happiness  i am sure .', 'what a blessing to young people to be in such hands ', 'your father and mother seem so totally free from all those ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct and misery  both in young and old .', 'i hope you think louisa perfectly recovered now ', 'he answered rather hesitatingly   yes  i believe i do  very much recovered  but she is altered  there is no running or jumping about  no laughing or dancing  it is quite different .', 'if one happens only to shut the door a little hard  she starts and wriggles like a young dab  chick in the water  and benwick sits at her elbow  reading verses  or whispering to her  all day long .', 'anne could not help laughing .', ' that cannot be much to your taste  i know  said she   but i do believe him to be an excellent young man .', ' to be sure he is .', 'nobody doubts it  and i hope you do not think i am so illiberal as to want every man to have the same objects and pleasures as myself .', 'i have a great value for benwick  and when one can but get him to talk  he has plenty to say .', 'his reading has done him no harm  for he has fought as well as read .', 'he is a brave fellow .', 'i got more acquainted with him last monday than ever i did before .', 'we had a famous set  to at rat  hunting all the morning in my father  s great barns  and he played his part so well that i have liked him the better ever since .', 'here they were interrupted by the absolute necessity of charles  s following the others to admire mirrors and china  but anne had heard enough to understand the present state of uppercross  and rejoice in its happiness  and though she sighed as she rejoiced  her sigh had none of the ill  will of envy in it .', 'she would certainly have risen to their blessings if she could  but she did not want to lessen theirs .', 'the visit passed off altogether in high good humour .', 'mary was in excellent spirits  enjoying the gaiety and the change  and so well satisfied with the journey in her mother  in  law  s carriage with four horses  and with her own complete independence of camden place  that she was exactly in a temper to admire everything as she ought  and enter most readily into all the superiorities of the house  as they were detailed to her .', 'she had no demands on her father or sister  and her consequence was just enough increased by their handsome drawing  rooms .', 'elizabeth was  for a short time  suffering a good deal .', 'she felt that mrs musgrove and all her party ought to be asked to dine with them  but she could not bear to have the difference of style  the reduction of servants  which a dinner must betray  witnessed by those who had been always so inferior to the elliots of kellynch .', 'it was a struggle between propriety and vanity  but vanity got the better  and then elizabeth was happy again .', 'these were her internal persuasions   old fashioned notions  country hospitality  we do not profess to give dinners  few people in bath do  lady alicia never does  did not even ask her own sister  s family  though they were here a month  and i dare say it would be very inconvenient to mrs musgrove  put her quite out of her way .', 'i am sure she would rather not come  she cannot feel easy with us .', 'i will ask them all for an evening  that will be much better  that will be a novelty and a treat .', 'they have not seen two such drawing rooms before .', 'they will be delighted to come to  morrow evening .', 'it shall be a regular party  small  but most elegant .', 'and this satisfied elizabeth  and when the invitation was given to the two present  and promised for the absent  mary was as completely satisfied .', 'she was particularly asked to meet mr elliot  and be introduced to lady dalrymple and miss carteret  who were fortunately already engaged to come  and she could not have received a more gratifying attention .', 'miss elliot was to have the honour of calling on mrs musgrove in the course of the morning  and anne walked off with charles and mary  to go and see her and henrietta directly .', 'her plan of sitting with lady russell must give way for the present .', 'they all three called in rivers street for a couple of minutes  but anne convinced herself that a day  s delay of the intended communication could be of no consequence  and hastened forward to the white hart  to see again the friends and companions of the last autumn  with an eagerness of good  will which many associations contributed to form .', 'they found mrs musgrove and her daughter within  and by themselves  and anne had the kindest welcome from each .', 'henrietta was exactly in that state of recently  improved views  of fresh  formed happiness  which made her full of regard and interest for everybody she had ever liked before at all  and mrs musgrove  s real affection had been won by her usefulness when they were in distress .', 'it was a heartiness  and a warmth  and a sincerity which anne delighted in the more  from the sad want of such blessings at home .', 'she was entreated to give them as much of her time as possible  invited for every day and all day long  or rather claimed as part of the family  and  in return  she naturally fell into all her wonted ways of attention and assistance  and on charles  s leaving them together  was listening to mrs musgrove  s history of louisa  and to henrietta  s of herself  giving opinions on business  and recommendations to shops  with intervals of every help which mary required  from altering her ribbon to settling her accounts  from finding her keys  and assorting her trinkets  to trying to convince her that she was not ill  used by anybody  which mary  well amused as she generally was  in her station at a window overlooking the entrance to the pump room  could not but have her moments of imagining .', 'a morning of thorough confusion was to be expected .', 'a large party in an hotel ensured a quick  changing  unsettled scene .', 'one five minutes brought a note  the next a parcel  and anne had not been there half an hour  when their dining  room  spacious as it was  seemed more than half filled  a party of steady old friends were seated around mrs musgrove  and charles came back with captains harville and wentworth .', 'the appearance of the latter could not be more than the surprise of the moment .', 'it was impossible for her to have forgotten to feel that this arrival of their common friends must be soon bringing them together again .', 'their last meeting had been most important in opening his feelings  she had derived from it a delightful conviction  but she feared from his looks  that the same unfortunate persuasion  which had hastened him away from the concert room  still governed .', 'he did not seem to want to be near enough for conversation .', 'she tried to be calm  and leave things to take their course  and tried to dwell much on this argument of rational dependence   surely  if there be constant attachment on each side  our hearts must understand each other ere long .', 'we are not boy and girl  to be captiously irritable  misled by every moment  s inadvertence  and wantonly playing with our own happiness .', 'and yet  a few minutes afterwards  she felt as if their being in company with each other  under their present circumstances  could only be exposing them to inadvertencies and misconstructions of the most mischievous kind .', ' anne  cried mary  still at her window   there is mrs clay  i am sure  standing under the colonnade  and a gentleman with her .', 'i saw them turn the corner from bath street just now .', 'they seemed deep in talk .', 'who is it ', 'come  and tell me .', 'good heavens ', 'i recollect .', 'it is mr elliot himself .', ' no  cried anne  quickly   it cannot be mr elliot  i assure you .', 'he was to leave bath at nine this morning  and does not come back till to  morrow .', 'as she spoke  she felt that captain wentworth was looking at her  the consciousness of which vexed and embarrassed her  and made her regret that she had said so much  simple as it was .', 'mary  resenting that she should be supposed not to know her own cousin  began talking very warmly about the family features  and protesting still more positively that it was mr elliot  calling again upon anne to come and look for herself  but anne did not mean to stir  and tried to be cool and unconcerned .', 'her distress returned  however  on perceiving smiles and intelligent glances pass between two or three of the lady visitors  as if they believed themselves quite in the secret .', 'it was evident that the report concerning her had spread  and a short pause succeeded  which seemed to ensure that it would now spread farther .', ' do come  anne  cried mary   come and look yourself .', 'you will be too late if you do not make haste .', 'they are parting  they are shaking hands .', 'he is turning away .', 'not know mr elliot  indeed ', 'you seem to have forgot all about lyme .', 'to pacify mary  and perhaps screen her own embarrassment  anne did move quietly to the window .', 'she was just in time to ascertain that it really was mr elliot  which she had never believed  before he disappeared on one side  as mrs clay walked quickly off on the other  and checking the surprise which she could not but feel at such an appearance of friendly conference between two persons of totally opposite interest  she calmly said   yes  it is mr elliot  certainly .', 'he has changed his hour of going  i suppose  that is all  or i may be mistaken  i might not attend  and walked back to her chair  recomposed  and with the comfortable hope of having acquitted herself well .', 'the visitors took their leave  and charles  having civilly seen them off  and then made a face at them  and abused them for coming  began with ', ' well  mother  i have done something for you that you will like .', 'i have been to the theatre  and secured a box for to  morrow night .', 'a  n  t i a good boy ', 'i know you love a play  and there is room for us all .', 'it holds nine .', 'i have engaged captain wentworth .', 'anne will not be sorry to join us  i am sure .', 'we all like a play .', 'have not i done well  mother ', 'mrs musgrove was good humouredly beginning to express her perfect readiness for the play  if henrietta and all the others liked it  when mary eagerly interrupted her by exclaiming ', ' good heavens  charles ', 'how can you think of such a thing ', 'take a box for to  morrow night ', 'have you forgot that we are engaged to camden place to  morrow night ', 'and that we were most particularly asked to meet lady dalrymple and her daughter  and mr elliot  and all the principal family connexions  on purpose to be introduced to them ', 'how can you be so forgetful ', ' phoo ', 'phoo ', 'replied charles   what  s an evening party ', 'never worth remembering .', 'your father might have asked us to dinner  i think  if he had wanted to see us .', 'you may do as you like  but i shall go to the play .', ' oh ', 'charles  i declare it will be too abominable if you do  when you promised to go .', ' no  i did not promise .', 'i only smirked and bowed  and said the word  happy .', 'there was no promise .', ' but you must go  charles .', 'it would be unpardonable to fail .', 'we were asked on purpose to be introduced .', 'there was always such a great connexion between the dalrymples and ourselves .', 'nothing ever happened on either side that was not announced immediately .', 'we are quite near relations  you know  and mr elliot too  whom you ought so particularly to be acquainted with ', 'every attention is due to mr elliot .', 'consider  my father  s heir  the future representative of the family .', ' don  t talk to me about heirs and representatives  cried charles .', ' i am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow to the rising sun .', 'if i would not go for the sake of your father  i should think it scandalous to go for the sake of his heir .', 'what is mr elliot to me ', 'the careless expression was life to anne  who saw that captain wentworth was all attention  looking and listening with his whole soul  and that the last words brought his enquiring eyes from charles to herself .', 'charles and mary still talked on in the same style  he  half serious and half jesting  maintaining the scheme for the play  and she  invariably serious  most warmly opposing it  and not omitting to make it known that  however determined to go to camden place herself  she should not think herself very well used  if they went to the play without her .', 'mrs musgrove interposed .', ' we had better put it off .', 'charles  you had much better go back and change the box for tuesday .', 'it would be a pity to be divided  and we should be losing miss anne  too  if there is a party at her father  s  and i am sure neither henrietta nor i should care at all for the play  if miss anne could not be with us .', 'anne felt truly obliged to her for such kindness  and quite as much so for the opportunity it gave her of decidedly saying ', ' if it depended only on my inclination  ma  am  the party at home  excepting on mary  s account  would not be the smallest impediment .', 'i have no pleasure in the sort of meeting  and should be too happy to change it for a play  and with you .', 'but  it had better not be attempted  perhaps .', 'she had spoken it  but she trembled when it was done  conscious that her words were listened to  and daring not even to try to observe their effect .', 'it was soon generally agreed that tuesday should be the day  charles only reserving the advantage of still teasing his wife  by persisting that he would go to the play to  morrow if nobody else would .', 'captain wentworth left his seat  and walked to the fire  place  probably for the sake of walking away from it soon afterwards  and taking a station  with less bare  faced design  by anne .', ' you have not been long enough in bath  said he   to enjoy the evening parties of the place .', ' oh ', 'no .', 'the usual character of them has nothing for me .', 'i am no card  player .', ' you were not formerly  i know .', 'you did not use to like cards  but time makes many changes .', ' i am not yet so much changed  cried anne  and stopped  fearing she hardly knew what misconstruction .', 'after waiting a few moments he said  and as if it were the result of immediate feeling   it is a period  indeed ', 'eight years and a half is a period .', 'whether he would have proceeded farther was left to anne  s imagination to ponder over in a calmer hour  for while still hearing the sounds he had uttered  she was startled to other subjects by henrietta  eager to make use of the present leisure for getting out  and calling on her companions to lose no time  lest somebody else should come in .', 'they were obliged to move .', 'anne talked of being perfectly ready  and tried to look it  but she felt that could henrietta have known the regret and reluctance of her heart in quitting that chair  in preparing to quit the room  she would have found  in all her own sensations for her cousin  in the very security of his affection  wherewith to pity her .', 'their preparations  however  were stopped short .', 'alarming sounds were heard  other visitors approached  and the door was thrown open for sir walter and miss elliot  whose entrance seemed to give a general chill .', 'anne felt an instant oppression  and wherever she looked saw symptoms of the same .', 'the comfort  the freedom  the gaiety of the room was over  hushed into cold composure  determined silence  or insipid talk  to meet the heartless elegance of her father and sister .', 'how mortifying to feel that it was so ', 'her jealous eye was satisfied in one particular .', 'captain wentworth was acknowledged again by each  by elizabeth more graciously than before .', 'she even addressed him once  and looked at him more than once .', 'elizabeth was  in fact  revolving a great measure .', 'the sequel explained it .', 'after the waste of a few minutes in saying the proper nothings  she began to give the invitation which was to comprise all the remaining dues of the musgroves .', ' to  morrow evening  to meet a few friends  no formal party .', 'it was all said very gracefully  and the cards with which she had provided herself  the  miss elliot at home  were laid on the table  with a courteous  comprehensive smile to all  and one smile and one card more decidedly for captain wentworth .', 'the truth was  that elizabeth had been long enough in bath to understand the importance of a man of such an air and appearance as his .', 'the past was nothing .', 'the present was that captain wentworth would move about well in her drawing  room .', 'the card was pointedly given  and sir walter and elizabeth arose and disappeared .', 'the interruption had been short  though severe  and ease and animation returned to most of those they left as the door shut them out  but not to anne .', 'she could think only of the invitation she had with such astonishment witnessed  and of the manner in which it had been received  a manner of doubtful meaning  of surprise rather than gratification  of polite acknowledgement rather than acceptance .', 'she knew him  she saw disdain in his eye  and could not venture to believe that he had determined to accept such an offering  as an atonement for all the insolence of the past .', 'her spirits sank .', 'he held the card in his hand after they were gone  as if deeply considering it .', ' only think of elizabeth  s including everybody ', 'whispered mary very audibly .', ' i do not wonder captain wentworth is delighted ', 'you see he cannot put the card out of his hand .', 'anne caught his eye  saw his cheeks glow  and his mouth form itself into a momentary expression of contempt  and turned away  that she might neither see nor hear more to vex her .', 'the party separated .', 'the gentlemen had their own pursuits  the ladies proceeded on their own business  and they met no more while anne belonged to them .', 'she was earnestly begged to return and dine  and give them all the rest of the day  but her spirits had been so long exerted that at present she felt unequal to more  and fit only for home  where she might be sure of being as silent as she chose .', 'promising to be with them the whole of the following morning  therefore  she closed the fatigues of the present by a toilsome walk to camden place  there to spend the evening chiefly in listening to the busy arrangements of elizabeth and mrs clay for the morrow  s party  the frequent enumeration of the persons invited  and the continually improving detail of all the embellishments which were to make it the most completely elegant of its kind in bath  while harassing herself with the never  ending question  of whether captain wentworth would come or not ', 'they were reckoning him as certain  but with her it was a gnawing solicitude never appeased for five minutes together .', 'she generally thought he would come  because she generally thought he ought  but it was a case which she could not so shape into any positive act of duty or discretion  as inevitably to defy the suggestions of very opposite feelings .', 'she only roused herself from the broodings of this restless agitation  to let mrs clay know that she had been seen with mr elliot three hours after his being supposed to be out of bath  for having watched in vain for some intimation of the interview from the lady herself  she determined to mention it  and it seemed to her there was guilt in mrs clay  s face as she listened .', 'it was transient  cleared away in an instant  but anne could imagine she read there the consciousness of having  by some complication of mutual trick  or some overbearing authority of his  been obliged to attend  perhaps for half an hour  to his lectures and restrictions on her designs on sir walter .', 'she exclaimed  however  with a very tolerable imitation of nature  ', ' oh ', 'dear ', 'very true .', 'only think  miss elliot  to my great surprise i met with mr elliot in bath street .', 'i was never more astonished .', 'he turned back and walked with me to the pump yard .', 'he had been prevented setting off for thornberry  but i really forget by what  for i was in a hurry  and could not much attend  and i can only answer for his being determined not to be delayed in his return .', 'he wanted to know how early he might be admitted to  morrow .', 'he was full of  to  morrow  and it is very evident that i have been full of it too  ever since i entered the house  and learnt the extension of your plan and all that had happened  or my seeing him could never have gone so entirely out of my head .', 'chapter ', 'one day only had passed since anne  s conversation with mrs smith  but a keener interest had succeeded  and she was now so little touched by mr elliot  s conduct  except by its effects in one quarter  that it became a matter of course the next morning  still to defer her explanatory visit in rivers street .', 'she had promised to be with the musgroves from breakfast to dinner .', 'her faith was plighted  and mr elliot  s character  like the sultaness scheherazade  s head  must live another day .', 'she could not keep her appointment punctually  however  the weather was unfavourable  and she had grieved over the rain on her friends  account  and felt it very much on her own  before she was able to attempt the walk .', 'when she reached the white hart  and made her way to the proper apartment  she found herself neither arriving quite in time  nor the first to arrive .', 'the party before her were  mrs musgrove  talking to mrs croft  and captain harville to captain wentworth  and she immediately heard that mary and henrietta  too impatient to wait  had gone out the moment it had cleared  but would be back again soon  and that the strictest injunctions had been left with mrs musgrove to keep her there till they returned .', 'she had only to submit  sit down  be outwardly composed  and feel herself plunged at once in all the agitations which she had merely laid her account of tasting a little before the morning closed .', 'there was no delay  no waste of time .', 'she was deep in the happiness of such misery  or the misery of such happiness  instantly .', 'two minutes after her entering the room  captain wentworth said ', ' we will write the letter we were talking of  harville  now  if you will give me materials .', 'materials were at hand  on a separate table  he went to it  and nearly turning his back to them all  was engrossed by writing .', 'mrs musgrove was giving mrs croft the history of her eldest daughter  s engagement  and just in that inconvenient tone of voice which was perfectly audible while it pretended to be a whisper .', 'anne felt that she did not belong to the conversation  and yet  as captain harville seemed thoughtful and not disposed to talk  she could not avoid hearing many undesirable particulars  such as   how mr musgrove and my brother hayter had met again and again to talk it over  what my brother hayter had said one day  and what mr musgrove had proposed the next  and what had occurred to my sister hayter  and what the young people had wished  and what i said at first i never could consent to  but was afterwards persuaded to think might do very well  and a great deal in the same style of open  hearted communication  minutiae which  even with every advantage of taste and delicacy  which good mrs musgrove could not give  could be properly interesting only to the principals .', 'mrs croft was attending with great good  humour  and whenever she spoke at all  it was very sensibly .', 'anne hoped the gentlemen might each be too much self  occupied to hear .', ' and so  ma  am  all these thing considered  said mrs musgrove  in her powerful whisper   though we could have wished it different  yet  altogether  we did not think it fair to stand out any longer  for charles hayter was quite wild about it  and henrietta was pretty near as bad  and so we thought they had better marry at once  and make the best of it  as many others have done before them .', 'at any rate  said i  it will be better than a long engagement .', ' that is precisely what i was going to observe  cried mrs croft .', ' i would rather have young people settle on a small income at once  and have to struggle with a few difficulties together  than be involved in a long engagement .', 'i always think that no mutual ', ' oh ', 'dear mrs croft  cried mrs musgrove  unable to let her finish her speech   there is nothing i so abominate for young people as a long engagement .', 'it is what i always protested against for my children .', 'it is all very well  i used to say  for young people to be engaged  if there is a certainty of their being able to marry in six months  or even in twelve  but a long engagement ', ' yes  dear ma  am  said mrs croft   or an uncertain engagement  an engagement which may be long .', 'to begin without knowing that at such a time there will be the means of marrying  i hold to be very unsafe and unwise  and what i think all parents should prevent as far as they can .', 'anne found an unexpected interest here .', 'she felt its application to herself  felt it in a nervous thrill all over her  and at the same moment that her eyes instinctively glanced towards the distant table  captain wentworth  s pen ceased to move  his head was raised  pausing  listening  and he turned round the next instant to give a look  one quick  conscious look at her .', 'the two ladies continued to talk  to re  urge the same admitted truths  and enforce them with such examples of the ill effect of a contrary practice as had fallen within their observation  but anne heard nothing distinctly  it was only a buzz of words in her ear  her mind was in confusion .', 'captain harville  who had in truth been hearing none of it  now left his seat  and moved to a window  and anne seeming to watch him  though it was from thorough absence of mind  became gradually sensible that he was inviting her to join him where he stood .', 'he looked at her with a smile  and a little motion of the head  which expressed   come to me  i have something to say  and the unaffected  easy kindness of manner which denoted the feelings of an older acquaintance than he really was  strongly enforced the invitation .', 'she roused herself and went to him .', 'the window at which he stood was at the other end of the room from where the two ladies were sitting  and though nearer to captain wentworth  s table  not very near .', 'as she joined him  captain harville  s countenance re  assumed the serious  thoughtful expression which seemed its natural character .', ' look here  said he  unfolding a parcel in his hand  and displaying a small miniature painting   do you know who that is ', ' certainly  captain benwick .', ' yes  and you may guess who it is for .', 'but   in a deep tone   it was not done for her .', 'miss elliot  do you remember our walking together at lyme  and grieving for him ', 'i little thought then  but no matter .', 'this was drawn at the cape .', 'he met with a clever young german artist at the cape  and in compliance with a promise to my poor sister  sat to him  and was bringing it home for her  and i have now the charge of getting it properly set for another ', 'it was a commission to me ', 'but who else was there to employ ', 'i hope i can allow for him .', 'i am not sorry  indeed  to make it over to another .', 'he undertakes it   looking towards captain wentworth   he is writing about it now .', 'and with a quivering lip he wound up the whole by adding   poor fanny ', 'she would not have forgotten him so soon ', ' no  replied anne  in a low  feeling voice .', ' that i can easily believe .', ' it was not in her nature .', 'she doted on him .', ' it would not be the nature of any woman who truly loved .', 'captain harville smiled  as much as to say   do you claim that for your sex ', 'and she answered the question  smiling also   yes .', 'we certainly do not forget you as soon as you forget us .', 'it is  perhaps  our fate rather than our merit .', 'we cannot help ourselves .', 'we live at home  quiet  confined  and our feelings prey upon us .', 'you are forced on exertion .', 'you have always a profession  pursuits  business of some sort or other  to take you back into the world immediately  and continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions .', ' granting your assertion that the world does all this so soon for men  which  however  i do not think i shall grant  it does not apply to benwick .', 'he has not been forced upon any exertion .', 'the peace turned him on shore at the very moment  and he has been living with us  in our little family circle  ever since .', ' true  said anne   very true  i did not recollect  but what shall we say now  captain harville ', 'if the change be not from outward circumstances  it must be from within  it must be nature  man  s nature  which has done the business for captain benwick .', ' no  no  it is not man  s nature .', 'i will not allow it to be more man  s nature than woman  s to be inconstant and forget those they do love  or have loved .', 'i believe the reverse .', 'i believe in a true analogy between our bodily frames and our mental  and that as our bodies are the strongest  so are our feelings  capable of bearing most rough usage  and riding out the heaviest weather .', ' your feelings may be the strongest  replied anne   but the same spirit of analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most tender .', 'man is more robust than woman  but he is not longer lived  which exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments .', 'nay  it would be too hard upon you  if it were otherwise .', 'you have difficulties  and privations  and dangers enough to struggle with .', 'you are always labouring and toiling  exposed to every risk and hardship .', 'your home  country  friends  all quitted .', 'neither time  nor health  nor life  to be called your own .', 'it would be hard  indeed   with a faltering voice   if woman  s feelings were to be added to all this .', ' we shall never agree upon this question  captain harville was beginning to say  when a slight noise called their attention to captain wentworth  s hitherto perfectly quiet division of the room .', 'it was nothing more than that his pen had fallen down  but anne was startled at finding him nearer than she had supposed  and half inclined to suspect that the pen had only fallen because he had been occupied by them  striving to catch sounds  which yet she did not think he could have caught .', ' have you finished your letter ', 'said captain harville .', ' not quite  a few lines more .', 'i shall have done in five minutes .', ' there is no hurry on my side .', 'i am only ready whenever you are .', 'i am in very good anchorage here   smiling at anne   well supplied  and want for nothing .', 'no hurry for a signal at all .', 'well  miss elliot   lowering his voice   as i was saying we shall never agree  i suppose  upon this point .', 'no man and woman  would  probably .', 'but let me observe that all histories are against you  all stories  prose and verse .', 'if i had such a memory as benwick  i could bring you fifty quotations in a moment on my side the argument  and i do not think i ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say upon woman  s inconstancy .', 'songs and proverbs  all talk of woman  s fickleness .', 'but perhaps you will say  these were all written by men .', ' perhaps i shall .', 'yes  yes  if you please  no reference to examples in books .', 'men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story .', 'education has been theirs in so much higher a degree  the pen has been in their hands .', 'i will not allow books to prove anything .', ' but how shall we prove anything ', ' we never shall .', 'we never can expect to prove any thing upon such a point .', 'it is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof .', 'we each begin  probably  with a little bias towards our own sex  and upon that bias build every circumstance in favour of it which has occurred within our own circle  many of which circumstances  perhaps those very cases which strike us the most  may be precisely such as cannot be brought forward without betraying a confidence  or in some respect saying what should not be said .', ' ah ', 'cried captain harville  in a tone of strong feeling   if i could but make you comprehend what a man suffers when he takes a last look at his wife and children  and watches the boat that he has sent them off in  as long as it is in sight  and then turns away and says   god knows whether we ever meet again ', 'and then  if i could convey to you the glow of his soul when he does see them again  when  coming back after a twelvemonth  s absence  perhaps  and obliged to put into another port  he calculates how soon it be possible to get them there  pretending to deceive himself  and saying   they cannot be here till such a day  but all the while hoping for them twelve hours sooner  and seeing them arrive at last  as if heaven had given them wings  by many hours sooner still ', 'if i could explain to you all this  and all that a man can bear and do  and glories to do  for the sake of these treasures of his existence ', 'i speak  you know  only of such men as have hearts ', 'pressing his own with emotion .', ' oh ', 'cried anne eagerly   i hope i do justice to all that is felt by you  and by those who resemble you .', 'god forbid that i should undervalue the warm and faithful feelings of any of my fellow  creatures ', 'i should deserve utter contempt if i dared to suppose that true attachment and constancy were known only by woman .', 'no  i believe you capable of everything great and good in your married lives .', 'i believe you equal to every important exertion  and to every domestic forbearance  so long as  if i may be allowed the expression  so long as you have an object .', 'i mean while the woman you love lives  and lives for you .', 'all the privilege i claim for my own sex  it is not a very enviable one  you need not covet it  is that of loving longest  when existence or when hope is gone .', 'she could not immediately have uttered another sentence  her heart was too full  her breath too much oppressed .', ' you are a good soul  cried captain harville  putting his hand on her arm  quite affectionately .', ' there is no quarrelling with you .', 'and when i think of benwick  my tongue is tied .', 'their attention was called towards the others .', 'mrs croft was taking leave .', ' here  frederick  you and i part company  i believe  said she .', ' i am going home  and you have an engagement with your friend .', 'to  night we may have the pleasure of all meeting again at your party   turning to anne .', ' we had your sister  s card yesterday  and i understood frederick had a card too  though i did not see it  and you are disengaged  frederick  are you not  as well as ourselves ', 'captain wentworth was folding up a letter in great haste  and either could not or would not answer fully .', ' yes  said he   very true  here we separate  but harville and i shall soon be after you  that is  harville  if you are ready  i am in half a minute .', 'i know you will not be sorry to be off .', 'i shall be at your service in half a minute .', 'mrs croft left them  and captain wentworth  having sealed his letter with great rapidity  was indeed ready  and had even a hurried  agitated air  which shewed impatience to be gone .', 'anne knew not how to understand it .', 'she had the kindest  good morning  god bless you ', 'from captain harville  but from him not a word  nor a look ', 'he had passed out of the room without a look ', 'she had only time  however  to move closer to the table where he had been writing  when footsteps were heard returning  the door opened  it was himself .', 'he begged their pardon  but he had forgotten his gloves  and instantly crossing the room to the writing table  he drew out a letter from under the scattered paper  placed it before anne with eyes of glowing entreaty fixed on her for a time  and hastily collecting his gloves  was again out of the room  almost before mrs musgrove was aware of his being in it  the work of an instant ', 'the revolution which one instant had made in anne  was almost beyond expression .', 'the letter  with a direction hardly legible  to  miss a . e . was evidently the one which he had been folding so hastily .', 'while supposed to be writing only to captain benwick  he had been also addressing her ', 'on the contents of that letter depended all which this world could do for her .', 'anything was possible  anything might be defied rather than suspense .', 'mrs musgrove had little arrangements of her own at her own table  to their protection she must trust  and sinking into the chair which he had occupied  succeeding to the very spot where he had leaned and written  her eyes devoured the following words ', ' i can listen no longer in silence .', 'i must speak to you by such means as are within my reach .', 'you pierce my soul .', 'i am half agony  half hope .', 'tell me not that i am too late  that such precious feelings are gone for ever .', 'i offer myself to you again with a heart even more your own than when you almost broke it  eight years and a half ago .', 'dare not say that man forgets sooner than woman  that his love has an earlier death .', 'i have loved none but you .', 'unjust i may have been  weak and resentful i have been  but never inconstant .', 'you alone have brought me to bath .', 'for you alone  i think and plan .', 'have you not seen this ', 'can you fail to have understood my wishes ', 'i had not waited even these ten days  could i have read your feelings  as i think you must have penetrated mine .', 'i can hardly write .', 'i am every instant hearing something which overpowers me .', 'you sink your voice  but i can distinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others .', 'too good  too excellent creature ', 'you do us justice  indeed .', 'you do believe that there is true attachment and constancy among men .', 'believe it to be most fervent  most undeviating  in f . w .', ' i must go  uncertain of my fate  but i shall return hither  or follow your party  as soon as possible .', 'a word  a look  will be enough to decide whether i enter your father  s house this evening or never .', 'such a letter was not to be soon recovered from .', 'half and hour  s solitude and reflection might have tranquillized her  but the ten minutes only which now passed before she was interrupted  with all the restraints of her situation  could do nothing towards tranquillity .', 'every moment rather brought fresh agitation .', 'it was overpowering happiness .', 'and before she was beyond the first stage of full sensation  charles  mary  and henrietta all came in .', 'the absolute necessity of seeming like herself produced then an immediate struggle  but after a while she could do no more .', 'she began not to understand a word they said  and was obliged to plead indisposition and excuse herself .', 'they could then see that she looked very ill  were shocked and concerned  and would not stir without her for the world .', 'this was dreadful .', 'would they only have gone away  and left her in the quiet possession of that room it would have been her cure  but to have them all standing or waiting around her was distracting  and in desperation  she said she would go home .', ' by all means  my dear  cried mrs musgrove   go home directly  and take care of yourself  that you may be fit for the evening .', 'i wish sarah was here to doctor you  but i am no doctor myself .', 'charles  ring and order a chair .', 'she must not walk .', 'but the chair would never do .', 'worse than all ', 'to lose the possibility of speaking two words to captain wentworth in the course of her quiet  solitary progress up the town  and she felt almost certain of meeting him  could not be borne .', 'the chair was earnestly protested against  and mrs musgrove  who thought only of one sort of illness  having assured herself with some anxiety  that there had been no fall in the case  that anne had not at any time lately slipped down  and got a blow on her head  that she was perfectly convinced of having had no fall  could part with her cheerfully  and depend on finding her better at night .', 'anxious to omit no possible precaution  anne struggled  and said ', ' i am afraid  ma  am  that it is not perfectly understood .', 'pray be so good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope to see your whole party this evening .', 'i am afraid there had been some mistake  and i wish you particularly to assure captain harville and captain wentworth  that we hope to see them both .', ' oh ', 'my dear  it is quite understood  i give you my word .', 'captain harville has no thought but of going .', ' do you think so ', 'but i am afraid  and i should be so very sorry .', 'will you promise me to mention it  when you see them again ', 'you will see them both this morning  i dare say .', 'do promise me .', ' to be sure i will  if you wish it .', 'charles  if you see captain harville anywhere  remember to give miss anne  s message .', 'but indeed  my dear  you need not be uneasy .', 'captain harville holds himself quite engaged  i  ll answer for it  and captain wentworth the same  i dare say .', 'anne could do no more  but her heart prophesied some mischance to damp the perfection of her felicity .', 'it could not be very lasting  however .', 'even if he did not come to camden place himself  it would be in her power to send an intelligible sentence by captain harville .', 'another momentary vexation occurred .', 'charles  in his real concern and good nature  would go home with her  there was no preventing him .', 'this was almost cruel .', 'but she could not be long ungrateful  he was sacrificing an engagement at a gunsmith  s  to be of use to her  and she set off with him  with no feeling but gratitude apparent .', 'they were on union street  when a quicker step behind  a something of familiar sound  gave her two moments  preparation for the sight of captain wentworth .', 'he joined them  but  as if irresolute whether to join or to pass on  said nothing  only looked .', 'anne could command herself enough to receive that look  and not repulsively .', 'the cheeks which had been pale now glowed  and the movements which had hesitated were decided .', 'he walked by her side .', 'presently  struck by a sudden thought  charles said ', ' captain wentworth  which way are you going ', 'only to gay street  or farther up the town ', ' i hardly know  replied captain wentworth  surprised .', ' are you going as high as belmont ', 'are you going near camden place ', 'because  if you are  i shall have no scruple in asking you to take my place  and give anne your arm to her father  s door .', 'she is rather done for this morning  and must not go so far without help  and i ought to be at that fellow  s in the market place .', 'he promised me the sight of a capital gun he is just going to send off  said he would keep it unpacked to the last possible moment  that i might see it  and if i do not turn back now  i have no chance .', 'by his description  a good deal like the second size double  barrel of mine  which you shot with one day round winthrop .', 'there could not be an objection .', 'there could be only the most proper alacrity  a most obliging compliance for public view  and smiles reined in and spirits dancing in private rapture .', 'in half a minute charles was at the bottom of union street again  and the other two proceeding together  and soon words enough had passed between them to decide their direction towards the comparatively quiet and retired gravel walk  where the power of conversation would make the present hour a blessing indeed  and prepare it for all the immortality which the happiest recollections of their own future lives could bestow .', 'there they exchanged again those feelings and those promises which had once before seemed to secure everything  but which had been followed by so many  many years of division and estrangement .', 'there they returned again into the past  more exquisitely happy  perhaps  in their re  union  than when it had been first projected  more tender  more tried  more fixed in a knowledge of each other  s character  truth  and attachment  more equal to act  more justified in acting .', 'and there  as they slowly paced the gradual ascent  heedless of every group around them  seeing neither sauntering politicians  bustling housekeepers  flirting girls  nor nursery  maids and children  they could indulge in those retrospections and acknowledgements  and especially in those explanations of what had directly preceded the present moment  which were so poignant and so ceaseless in interest .', 'all the little variations of the last week were gone through  and of yesterday and today there could scarcely be an end .', 'she had not mistaken him .', 'jealousy of mr elliot had been the retarding weight  the doubt  the torment .', 'that had begun to operate in the very hour of first meeting her in bath  that had returned  after a short suspension  to ruin the concert  and that had influenced him in everything he had said and done  or omitted to say and do  in the last four  and  twenty hours .', 'it had been gradually yielding to the better hopes which her looks  or words  or actions occasionally encouraged  it had been vanquished at last by those sentiments and those tones which had reached him while she talked with captain harville  and under the irresistible governance of which he had seized a sheet of paper  and poured out his feelings .', 'of what he had then written  nothing was to be retracted or qualified .', 'he persisted in having loved none but her .', 'she had never been supplanted .', 'he never even believed himself to see her equal .', 'thus much indeed he was obliged to acknowledge  that he had been constant unconsciously  nay unintentionally  that he had meant to forget her  and believed it to be done .', 'he had imagined himself indifferent  when he had only been angry  and he had been unjust to her merits  because he had been a sufferer from them .', 'her character was now fixed on his mind as perfection itself  maintaining the loveliest medium of fortitude and gentleness  but he was obliged to acknowledge that only at uppercross had he learnt to do her justice  and only at lyme had he begun to understand himself .', 'at lyme  he had received lessons of more than one sort .', 'the passing admiration of mr elliot had at least roused him  and the scenes on the cobb and at captain harville  s had fixed her superiority .', 'in his preceding attempts to attach himself to louisa musgrove  the attempts of angry pride  he protested that he had for ever felt it to be impossible  that he had not cared  could not care  for louisa  though till that day  till the leisure for reflection which followed it  he had not understood the perfect excellence of the mind with which louisa  s could so ill bear a comparison  or the perfect unrivalled hold it possessed over his own .', 'there  he had learnt to distinguish between the steadiness of principle and the obstinacy of self  will  between the darings of heedlessness and the resolution of a collected mind .', 'there he had seen everything to exalt in his estimation the woman he had lost  and there begun to deplore the pride  the folly  the madness of resentment  which had kept him from trying to regain her when thrown in his way .', 'from that period his penance had become severe .', 'he had no sooner been free from the horror and remorse attending the first few days of louisa  s accident  no sooner begun to feel himself alive again  than he had begun to feel himself  though alive  not at liberty .', ' i found  said he   that i was considered by harville an engaged man ', 'that neither harville nor his wife entertained a doubt of our mutual attachment .', 'i was startled and shocked .', 'to a degree  i could contradict this instantly  but  when i began to reflect that others might have felt the same  her own family  nay  perhaps herself  i was no longer at my own disposal .', 'i was hers in honour if she wished it .', 'i had been unguarded .', 'i had not thought seriously on this subject before .', 'i had not considered that my excessive intimacy must have its danger of ill consequence in many ways  and that i had no right to be trying whether i could attach myself to either of the girls  at the risk of raising even an unpleasant report  were there no other ill effects .', 'i had been grossly wrong  and must abide the consequences .', 'he found too late  in short  that he had entangled himself  and that precisely as he became fully satisfied of his not caring for louisa at all  he must regard himself as bound to her  if her sentiments for him were what the harvilles supposed .', 'it determined him to leave lyme  and await her complete recovery elsewhere .', 'he would gladly weaken  by any fair means  whatever feelings or speculations concerning him might exist  and he went  therefore  to his brother  s  meaning after a while to return to kellynch  and act as circumstances might require .', ' i was six weeks with edward  said he   and saw him happy .', 'i could have no other pleasure .', 'i deserved none .', 'he enquired after you very particularly  asked even if you were personally altered  little suspecting that to my eye you could never alter .', 'anne smiled  and let it pass .', 'it was too pleasing a blunder for a reproach .', 'it is something for a woman to be assured  in her eight  and  twentieth year  that she has not lost one charm of earlier youth  but the value of such homage was inexpressibly increased to anne  by comparing it with former words  and feeling it to be the result  not the cause of a revival of his warm attachment .', 'he had remained in shropshire  lamenting the blindness of his own pride  and the blunders of his own calculations  till at once released from louisa by the astonishing and felicitous intelligence of her engagement with benwick .', ' here  said he   ended the worst of my state  for now i could at least put myself in the way of happiness  i could exert myself  i could do something .', 'but to be waiting so long in inaction  and waiting only for evil  had been dreadful .', 'within the first five minutes i said   i will be at bath on wednesday  and i was .', 'was it unpardonable to think it worth my while to come ', 'and to arrive with some degree of hope ', 'you were single .', 'it was possible that you might retain the feelings of the past  as i did  and one encouragement happened to be mine .', 'i could never doubt that you would be loved and sought by others  but i knew to a certainty that you had refused one man  at least  of better pretensions than myself  and i could not help often saying   was this for me ', 'their first meeting in milsom street afforded much to be said  but the concert still more .', 'that evening seemed to be made up of exquisite moments .', 'the moment of her stepping forward in the octagon room to speak to him  the moment of mr elliot  s appearing and tearing her away  and one or two subsequent moments  marked by returning hope or increasing despondency  were dwelt on with energy .', ' to see you  cried he   in the midst of those who could not be my well  wishers  to see your cousin close by you  conversing and smiling  and feel all the horrible eligibilities and proprieties of the match ', 'to consider it as the certain wish of every being who could hope to influence you ', 'even if your own feelings were reluctant or indifferent  to consider what powerful supports would be his ', 'was it not enough to make the fool of me which i appeared ', 'how could i look on without agony ', 'was not the very sight of the friend who sat behind you  was not the recollection of what had been  the knowledge of her influence  the indelible  immoveable impression of what persuasion had once done  was it not all against me ', ' you should have distinguished  replied anne .', ' you should not have suspected me now  the case is so different  and my age is so different .', 'if i was wrong in yielding to persuasion once  remember that it was to persuasion exerted on the side of safety  not of risk .', 'when i yielded  i thought it was to duty  but no duty could be called in aid here .', 'in marrying a man indifferent to me  all risk would have been incurred  and all duty violated .', ' perhaps i ought to have reasoned thus  he replied   but i could not .', 'i could not derive benefit from the late knowledge i had acquired of your character .', 'i could not bring it into play  it was overwhelmed  buried  lost in those earlier feelings which i had been smarting under year after year .', 'i could think of you only as one who had yielded  who had given me up  who had been influenced by any one rather than by me .', 'i saw you with the very person who had guided you in that year of misery .', 'i had no reason to believe her of less authority now .', 'the force of habit was to be added .', ' i should have thought  said anne   that my manner to yourself might have spared you much or all of this .', ' no  no ', 'your manner might be only the ease which your engagement to another man would give .', 'i left you in this belief  and yet  i was determined to see you again .', 'my spirits rallied with the morning  and i felt that i had still a motive for remaining here .', 'at last anne was at home again  and happier than any one in that house could have conceived .', 'all the surprise and suspense  and every other painful part of the morning dissipated by this conversation  she re  entered the house so happy as to be obliged to find an alloy in some momentary apprehensions of its being impossible to last .', 'an interval of meditation  serious and grateful  was the best corrective of everything dangerous in such high  wrought felicity  and she went to her room  and grew steadfast and fearless in the thankfulness of her enjoyment .', 'the evening came  the drawing  rooms were lighted up  the company assembled .', 'it was but a card party  it was but a mixture of those who had never met before  and those who met too often  a commonplace business  too numerous for intimacy  too small for variety  but anne had never found an evening shorter .', 'glowing and lovely in sensibility and happiness  and more generally admired than she thought about or cared for  she had cheerful or forbearing feelings for every creature around her .', 'mr elliot was there  she avoided  but she could pity him .', 'the wallises  she had amusement in understanding them .', 'lady dalrymple and miss carteret  they would soon be innoxious cousins to her .', 'she cared not for mrs clay  and had nothing to blush for in the public manners of her father and sister .', 'with the musgroves  there was the happy chat of perfect ease  with captain harville  the kind  hearted intercourse of brother and sister  with lady russell  attempts at conversation  which a delicious consciousness cut short  with admiral and mrs croft  everything of peculiar cordiality and fervent interest  which the same consciousness sought to conceal  and with captain wentworth  some moments of communications continually occurring  and always the hope of more  and always the knowledge of his being there .', 'it was in one of these short meetings  each apparently occupied in admiring a fine display of greenhouse plants  that she said ', ' i have been thinking over the past  and trying impartially to judge of the right and wrong  i mean with regard to myself  and i must believe that i was right  much as i suffered from it  that i was perfectly right in being guided by the friend whom you will love better than you do now .', 'to me  she was in the place of a parent .', 'do not mistake me  however .', 'i am not saying that she did not err in her advice .', 'it was  perhaps  one of those cases in which advice is good or bad only as the event decides  and for myself  i certainly never should  in any circumstance of tolerable similarity  give such advice .', 'but i mean  that i was right in submitting to her  and that if i had done otherwise  i should have suffered more in continuing the engagement than i did even in giving it up  because i should have suffered in my conscience .', 'i have now  as far as such a sentiment is allowable in human nature  nothing to reproach myself with  and if i mistake not  a strong sense of duty is no bad part of a woman  s portion .', 'he looked at her  looked at lady russell  and looking again at her  replied  as if in cool deliberation ', ' not yet .', 'but there are hopes of her being forgiven in time .', 'i trust to being in charity with her soon .', 'but i too have been thinking over the past  and a question has suggested itself  whether there may not have been one person more my enemy even than that lady ', 'my own self .', 'tell me if  when i returned to england in the year eight  with a few thousand pounds  and was posted into the laconia  if i had then written to you  would you have answered my letter ', 'would you  in short  have renewed the engagement then ', ' would i ', 'was all her answer  but the accent was decisive enough .', ' good god ', 'he cried   you would ', 'it is not that i did not think of it  or desire it  as what could alone crown all my other success  but i was proud  too proud to ask again .', 'i did not understand you .', 'i shut my eyes  and would not understand you  or do you justice .', 'this is a recollection which ought to make me forgive every one sooner than myself .', 'six years of separation and suffering might have been spared .', 'it is a sort of pain  too  which is new to me .', 'i have been used to the gratification of believing myself to earn every blessing that i enjoyed .', 'i have valued myself on honourable toils and just rewards .', 'like other great men under reverses  he added  with a smile .', ' i must endeavour to subdue my mind to my fortune .', 'i must learn to brook being happier than i deserve .', 'chapter ', 'who can be in doubt of what followed ', 'when any two young people take it into their heads to marry  they are pretty sure by perseverance to carry their point  be they ever so poor  or ever so imprudent  or ever so little likely to be necessary to each other  s ultimate comfort .', 'this may be bad morality to conclude with  but i believe it to be truth  and if such parties succeed  how should a captain wentworth and an anne elliot  with the advantage of maturity of mind  consciousness of right  and one independent fortune between them  fail of bearing down every opposition ', 'they might in fact  have borne down a great deal more than they met with  for there was little to distress them beyond the want of graciousness and warmth .', 'sir walter made no objection  and elizabeth did nothing worse than look cold and unconcerned .', 'captain wentworth  with five  and  twenty thousand pounds  and as high in his profession as merit and activity could place him  was no longer nobody .', 'he was now esteemed quite worthy to address the daughter of a foolish  spendthrift baronet  who had not had principle or sense enough to maintain himself in the situation in which providence had placed him  and who could give his daughter at present but a small part of the share of ten thousand pounds which must be hers hereafter .', 'sir walter  indeed  though he had no affection for anne  and no vanity flattered  to make him really happy on the occasion  was very far from thinking it a bad match for her .', 'on the contrary  when he saw more of captain wentworth  saw him repeatedly by daylight  and eyed him well  he was very much struck by his personal claims  and felt that his superiority of appearance might be not unfairly balanced against her superiority of rank  and all this  assisted by his well  sounding name  enabled sir walter at last to prepare his pen  with a very good grace  for the insertion of the marriage in the volume of honour .', 'the only one among them  whose opposition of feeling could excite any serious anxiety was lady russell .', 'anne knew that lady russell must be suffering some pain in understanding and relinquishing mr elliot  and be making some struggles to become truly acquainted with  and do justice to captain wentworth .', 'this however was what lady russell had now to do .', 'she must learn to feel that she had been mistaken with regard to both  that she had been unfairly influenced by appearances in each  that because captain wentworth  s manners had not suited her own ideas  she had been too quick in suspecting them to indicate a character of dangerous impetuosity  and that because mr elliot  s manners had precisely pleased her in their propriety and correctness  their general politeness and suavity  she had been too quick in receiving them as the certain result of the most correct opinions and well  regulated mind .', 'there was nothing less for lady russell to do  than to admit that she had been pretty completely wrong  and to take up a new set of opinions and of hopes .', 'there is a quickness of perception in some  a nicety in the discernment of character  a natural penetration  in short  which no experience in others can equal  and lady russell had been less gifted in this part of understanding than her young friend .', 'but she was a very good woman  and if her second object was to be sensible and well  judging  her first was to see anne happy .', 'she loved anne better than she loved her own abilities  and when the awkwardness of the beginning was over  found little hardship in attaching herself as a mother to the man who was securing the happiness of her other child .', 'of all the family  mary was probably the one most immediately gratified by the circumstance .', 'it was creditable to have a sister married  and she might flatter herself with having been greatly instrumental to the connexion  by keeping anne with her in the autumn  and as her own sister must be better than her husband  s sisters  it was very agreeable that captain wentworth should be a richer man than either captain benwick or charles hayter .', 'she had something to suffer  perhaps  when they came into contact again  in seeing anne restored to the rights of seniority  and the mistress of a very pretty landaulette  but she had a future to look forward to  of powerful consolation .', 'anne had no uppercross hall before her  no landed estate  no headship of a family  and if they could but keep captain wentworth from being made a baronet  she would not change situations with anne .', 'it would be well for the eldest sister if she were equally satisfied with her situation  for a change is not very probable there .', 'she had soon the mortification of seeing mr elliot withdraw  and no one of proper condition has since presented himself to raise even the unfounded hopes which sunk with him .', 'the news of his cousins anne  s engagement burst on mr elliot most unexpectedly .', 'it deranged his best plan of domestic happiness  his best hope of keeping sir walter single by the watchfulness which a son  in  law  s rights would have given .', 'but  though discomfited and disappointed  he could still do something for his own interest and his own enjoyment .', 'he soon quitted bath  and on mrs clay  s quitting it soon afterwards  and being next heard of as established under his protection in london  it was evident how double a game he had been playing  and how determined he was to save himself from being cut out by one artful woman  at least .', 'mrs clay  s affections had overpowered her interest  and she had sacrificed  for the young man  s sake  the possibility of scheming longer for sir walter .', 'she has abilities  however  as well as affections  and it is now a doubtful point whether his cunning  or hers  may finally carry the day  whether  after preventing her from being the wife of sir walter  he may not be wheedled and caressed at last into making her the wife of sir william .', 'it cannot be doubted that sir walter and elizabeth were shocked and mortified by the loss of their companion  and the discovery of their deception in her .', 'they had their great cousins  to be sure  to resort to for comfort  but they must long feel that to flatter and follow others  without being flattered and followed in turn  is but a state of half enjoyment .', 'anne  satisfied at a very early period of lady russell  s meaning to love captain wentworth as she ought  had no other alloy to the happiness of her prospects than what arose from the consciousness of having no relations to bestow on him which a man of sense could value .', 'there she felt her own inferiority very keenly .', 'the disproportion in their fortune was nothing  it did not give her a moment  s regret  but to have no family to receive and estimate him properly  nothing of respectability  of harmony  of good will to offer in return for all the worth and all the prompt welcome which met her in his brothers and sisters  was a source of as lively pain as her mind could well be sensible of under circumstances of otherwise strong felicity .', 'she had but two friends in the world to add to his list  lady russell and mrs smith .', 'to those  however  he was very well disposed to attach himself .', 'lady russell  in spite of all her former transgressions  he could now value from his heart .', 'while he was not obliged to say that he believed her to have been right in originally dividing them  he was ready to say almost everything else in her favour  and as for mrs smith  she had claims of various kinds to recommend her quickly and permanently .', 'her recent good offices by anne had been enough in themselves  and their marriage  instead of depriving her of one friend  secured her two .', 'she was their earliest visitor in their settled life  and captain wentworth  by putting her in the way of recovering her husband  s property in the west indies  by writing for her  acting for her  and seeing her through all the petty difficulties of the case with the activity and exertion of a fearless man and a determined friend  fully requited the services which she had rendered  or ever meant to render  to his wife .', 'mrs smith  s enjoyments were not spoiled by this improvement of income  with some improvement of health  and the acquisition of such friends to be often with  for her cheerfulness and mental alacrity did not fail her  and while these prime supplies of good remained  she might have bid defiance even to greater accessions of worldly prosperity .', 'she might have been absolutely rich and perfectly healthy  and yet be happy .', 'her spring of felicity was in the glow of her spirits  as her friend anne  s was in the warmth of her heart .', 'anne was tenderness itself  and she had the full worth of it in captain wentworth  s affection .', 'his profession was all that could ever make her friends wish that tenderness less  the dread of a future war all that could dim her sunshine .', 'she gloried in being a sailor  s wife  but she must pay the tax of quick alarm for belonging to that profession which is  if possible  more distinguished in its domestic virtues than in its national importance .', 'finis']\n"

            "The long and everincreasing column of sportsmen is now moving into a new era . Modern times have changed the world beyond recognition . The early years of the twentieth century seem very far away . But with all the changes in philosophy  dress and terrain  a few things remain constant  including the devotion of Americans to the great field sports  hunting and fishing . As the generations move on  clothes become more suitable for the enjoyment of outdoor sports . Sporting firearms change  markedly for the better . Just as modern transportation has outmoded the early Studebaker covered wagon  the demand of todays sportsmen and women has necessitated changes in their equipment . The American firearms and ammunition manufacturers through diligent research and technical development have replaced the muzzle loader and slowfiring singleshot arms with modern fast firing autoloaders  extremely accurate bolt  lever  and slide action firearms . And millions of rounds of entirely new and modern smallarms ammunition  designed for todays hunting and target shooting . And due to modern resourceuse and game management practices  there is still game to shoot  even with the everexpanding encroachment on land and water . Present conservation practices regard wildlife  not as an expendable natural resource  but as an annual harvest to be sown and also reaped . Unlimited game bags are possible and legal in more than  states  on shooting preserves  one of the newer phases of modern gamemanagement  for five and six months each year . Close to two million game birds were harvested on  commercial and private shooting preserves  and on State Game Commissioncontrolled upland game areas during the  season . The shooting development program of the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers Institute has successfully published these facts in all major outdoor magazines  many national weeklies and the trade papers . The most effective way to develop more places for more sportsmen to shoot is to encourage properly managed shooting preserves . This has been the aim of the director of the shooting development program  the New York staff of the Sportsmens Service Bureau  and the SAAMI shooting preserve field consultants since the start of the program in  . Following the kickoff of SAAMIs shooting development program in   a most interesting meeting took place in Washington  D.C. . The group known as the American Association for Health   Physical Education  and Recreation  a division of the National Education Association  initiated a conference which brought together representatives of the National Rifle Association  SAAMI and the American Fishing Tackle Manufacturers . This meeting was called to determine how these groups might cooperate to launch what is known as the Outdoor Education Project . The Outdoor Education Project took cognizance of the fact  so often overlooked  that athletic activities stressed in most school programs have little or no relationship to the physical and mental needs and interests of later life . The various team sports assuredly have their place in every school  and they are important to proper physical development . But with the exception of professional athletes  few contact sports and physical education activities in our schools have any carryover in the adult life of the average American man or woman . Following a vigorous campaign of interpretation and leadership development by OEP director Dr. Julian Smith  today thousands of secondary schools  colleges and universities have shooting and hunting education in their physical education and recreation programs . SAAMIs financial support since  has contributed to the success of this project in education . Personnel assigned through the shooting development program have proudly participated in over  state and regional workshops  at which hundreds of school administrators  teachers  professors  and recreational leaders have been introduced to Outdoor Education . Considering that the current schoolage potential is  million youths  the project and its message on hunting and shooting education have many more to reach . In  SAAMIs shooting development program announced a new activity designed to expose thousands of teenage boys and girls to the healthy fun enjoyed through the participation in the shooting sports . This program is now nationally known as  Teen Hunter Clubs  . Teen Hunter Clubs were initially sponsored by affiliated members of the Allied Merchandising Corporation . The first program was sponsored by Abraham  Strauss  Hempstead  New York  under the direction of Special Events director Jennings Dennis . Other pilot programs were conducted by A  S  Babylon  New York   J. L. Hudson  Detroit   Joseph Horne  Pittsburgh . Other THC activities followed  conducted by shopping centers  department stores  recreation equipment dealers  radioTV stations  newspapers  and other organizations interested in the need existing to acquaint youngsters with the proper use of sporting firearms and the development of correct attitudes and appreciations related to hunting and wise use of our natural resources . SAAMIs field men have served as consultants andor have participated in  Teen Hunter Club activities which have reached over  enthusiastic young Americans . Through the efforts of SAAMIs shooting development program these shooting activities  and many others  including assists in the development of public and privately financed shooting parks  trap and skeet leagues  rifle and pistol marksmanship programs have been promoted  to mention only a few . The continuation and expansion of the shooting development program will assure to some degree that national and community leaders will be made aware of the evergrowing need for shooting facilities and activities for hunting and shooting in answer to public demand . While individual sportsmen are aware of this situation  too many of our political  social  educational and even religious leaders too often forget it . Help is needed from dealers  at the grassroots level . The American gun and ammunition producers sponsor a successful promotional program through their industry trade association . Since SAAMIs conception in   and more specifically since the adoption of the Shooting Development Program in   millions of dollars and promotional manhours have gone into the development of more places to shoot for more youths and adults . We trust that you  as a gun and ammunition dealer  have benefited through additional sales of equipment . Are you getting top dollar from the shooting sports   Are you looking ahead to the exploding market of millions of American boys and girls  who will grow up to enjoy a traditional American way of life  ranging the fields with a fine American gun and uniformly excellent ammunition   Is your sporting firearms and ammunition department primed for the expanding horizons   Would you like to organize Teen Hunters Clubs  shooting programs  and have information on seasons including six months of hunting with unlimited game bags on shooting preserves   Ask Sammy Shooter . We were camping a few weeks ago on Cape Hatteras Campground in that land of pirates  seagulls and bluefish on North Carolinas famed Outer Banks . This beach campground with no trees or hills presents a constant camping show with all manner of equipment in actual use . With the whole camp exposed to view we could see the variety of canvas shelters in which Americans are camping now . There were umbrella tents  wall tents  cottage tents  station wagon tents  pup tents  Pop tents  Baker tents  tents with exterior frames  camper trailers  travel trailers  and even a few surplus parachutes serving as sunshades over entire family camps . Moving around camp we saw all kinds of camp stoves  lanterns  coolers  bedding  games  fishing tackle  windbreaks and sunshades . We saw similar displays in the other three campgrounds in this milelong National Seashore Recreation Area . Dealers would do well to visit such a campground often  look at the equipment and talk with the campers . Here you begin to appreciate the scope of the challenges and possibilities facing the industry . Camping is big and getting bigger . No one knows where it will stop . Almost every official who reflects on it thinks this movement of Americans to canvas dwellings opens one of the most promising of all outdoor markets . You read various guesses on how many Americans are camping . The number depends on who is talking at the moment . The figures range as high as  million families . Ive heard  million mentioned often  but Im more inclined to think there may be a total of some five to seven million families camping . Seven million families would total  million Americans or more . Consider the equipment needed to protect this many from the weather  to make their cooking easy and their sleeping comfortable . More campers than campsites Harassed state park officials often have more campers than they know what to do with . They are struggling to meet the demand for camping space  but families are being turned away  especially on holiday weekends . The National Parks  always popular camping places  are facing the same pressure . The National Park Service hopes by  to have  campsites available for  campers a day  almost twice what there are at present . The U.S. Forest Service cares for hundreds of thousands of campers in its  National Forests and is increasing its facilities steadily . But the campers still come . They bring their families and tents and camp kitchens and bedding . They bring their fishing rods and binoculars and bathing suits . They come prepared for family fun because Americans in evergrowing numbers are learning that here is the way to a fine economical vacation that becomes a family experience of lasting importance . Why they keep coming There are a half dozen reasons helping to account for the migration to the campgrounds . Among them  according to the U.S. Department of Commerce  are     shorter work weeks     higher pay     longer paid vacations     better transportation     earlier retirement  and    more education . The more people learn about their country  the more they want to learn . Camping is family fun  and it is helping more Americans see more of the country than they ever saw before . But make no mistake about it  the first reason people turn to camping is one of economy . Here is the promise of a vacation trip they can afford . The American Automobile Association  computing the cost for two people to vacation by automobile  comes up with an average daily expenditure figure of  . The AAA then splits it down this way  . for meals  . for lodging   for gas and oil  and  for tips and miscellaneous . What does the camping couple do to this set of figures   The . for lodging they save . Because they prepare their own meals they also keep in their pockets a good portion of that . food bill along with most of the tip money . The automobile expenses are about the only vacationing cost they cant either eliminate or pare down drastically by camping along the way . Where Americans used to think of a single vacation each summer  they now think about how many vacations they can have . Long weekends enable many to get away from home for three or four days several times a year . And even if they stay in resorts part of the time  they might  if the right salesman gets them in tow  develop a yearning to spice the usual vacation fare with a camping trip into the wide open spaces . It would be a mistake to sell those thousands of beginning campers on the idea theyre buying the comforts of home . Theyre not . Home is the place to find the comforts of home . Theyre buying fun and adventure and family experiences . But it would also be a mistake for them not to realize how comfortable camping has become . This is no longer a way of life for the bearded logger and the wandering cowboy . Todays campers want comforts  and they have them . And this helps explain why so many people are now going camping . Its fun  and its easy  so easy that there is time left after cooking  and tent keeping  for the women to get out and enjoy outdoor fun with their families . Camp meals are no great problem . Neither are beds  thanks to air mattresses and sleeping bags . Neither are shelters  because there is one to meet the needs of every camper or prospective camper . But there is still the sometimes complex problem of helping campers choose the best equipment for their individual needs .\n",

            "The most beautiful bed of pansies Ive seen was in a South Dakota yard on a sizzling day . Pansies are supposed to like it cool  but those great velvety flowers were healthy and perky in the glaring sun . I sought out the gardener and asked him what he did to produce such beauties in that weather . He seemed puzzled by my question .  I just love them   he said . The more I talked with him  the more convinced I became that that was the secret of their riotous blooming . Of course his love was expressed in intelligent care . He planted the pansy seeds himself  buying them from a pansy specialist . These specialists  I learned  have done a great deal of work to improve the size and health of the plants and the resulting flowers . Their seeds produce vigorous blooming plants half again the size of the unimproved strains . I asked him if he took seeds from his own plants . Occasionally  when he had an unusual flower that he wanted more of he did   but pansy seeds  he told me  soon  run down  . Its best to buy them fresh from a dealer who is working to improve them . His soil was  nothing special   just prairie land  but he had harrowed in compost until it was loose  spongy and brownblack . I fingered it and had the feeling of adequacy that comes with the right texture  tilth and body . It isnt easy to describe it  but every gardener knows it when his fingers touch such soil . Nothing is easier to grow from seed than pansies . They germinate quickly  the tiny plants appearing in a week  and grow along lustily . It doesnt really matter which month of the year you sow them  but they germinate best when they have a wide variation of temperature  very warm followed by cool in the same  hours . I like to make a seedbed right in the open  though many people start them successfully in cold frames . Pansies dont have to be coddled   theyd rather have things rugged  with only moderate protection on the coldest days . If you do use a cold frame be sure that its ventilation is adequate . For my seedbed I use good garden soil with a little sand added to encourage rooting . I dig it  rake it smooth  sow the seeds and wet them down with a fog spray . Then I cover the sowing with a board . This keeps it cool and moist and protects it from birds . Ants carry away the seeds so better be sure that there are no ant hills nearby . When the first sprinkling of green appears I remove the board . A light  porous mulch applied now keeps the roots cool and the soil soft during these early days of growth . I like sawdust for this  or hay . When they have  to  leaves and are thrifty little plants  its time to set them out where they are to remain . Every time you transplant a pansy you cause its flowers to become smaller . The moral is  dont transplant it any oftener than you must . As soon as they are large enough to move  I put mine  inches apart where they are to bloom . I put a little scoop of pulverized phosphate rock or steamed bone meal into each hole with the plant . That encourages rooting  and the better developed the roots  the larger and more plentiful the flowers . Pansies are gluttons . I doubt if it is possible to overfeed them . I spade lots of compost into their bed   lacking that  decayed manure spread over the bed is fine . One year I simply set the plants in the remains of a compost pile  to which a little sand had been added  and I had the most beautiful pansies in my  or any of my neighbors experience . In addition to the rich soil they benefit by feedings of manure water every other week  diluted to the color of weak tea . As a substitute for this  organic fertilizer dissolved in water to half the strength in the directions  may be used . They need mulch . We put a light mulch over the seedlings   now we must use a heavy one . Three inches of porous material will do a good job of keeping weeds down and the soil moist and cool . When winter comes be ready with additional mulch . I like hay for this and apply it so that only the tops of the plants show right after a good frost . That keeps in the cold  retains moisture and prevents the heaving of alternate freezing and thawing . Dont miss the pansies that appear from time to time through the winter . Whenever there is a thaw or a few sunny days  youll be likely to find a brave little blossom or two . If those arent enough for you  why not grow some just for winter blooming   The pansies I cherished most bloomed for me in February during a particularly cold winter . I started the seed in a flat in June and set out the little pansies in a cold frame .  An unheated greenhouse would have been better  if I had had one .  The plants took zero nights in their stride  with nothing but a mat of straw over the glass to protect them . In response to the lengthening days of February they budded  then bloomed their inch velvety flowers . That cold frame was my morale builder   its mass of bright bloom set in a border of snow made my spirits rise every time I looked at it . Like strawberries in December  pansies are far more exciting in February than in May . Try that late winter pickup when you are so tired of cold and snow that you feel you just cant take another day of it . The day will come  in midsummer  when you find your plants becoming  leggy   running to tallgrowing foliage at the expense of blossoms . Try pegging down each separate branch to the earth  using a bobby pin to hold it there . Pick the flowers  keep the soil dampened  and each of the peggeddown branches will take root and become a little plant and go on blooming for the rest of the season . As soon as an experimental tug assures you that roots have taken over  cut it off from the mother plant . A second and also good practice is to shear off the tops  leaving an inch high stub with just a leaf or two on each branch . These cutdown plants will bud and blossom in record time and will behave just as they did in early spring . I like to shear half my plants at a time  leaving one half of them to blossom while the second half is getting started on its new round of blooming . Probably no one needs to tell you that the way to stop all bloom is to let the blossoms go to seed . Natures aim  different from ours  is to provide for the coming generation . That done  her work is accomplished and she ignores the plant . Here is a word of advice when you go shopping for your pansy seeds . Go to a reputable grower  preferably a pansy specialist . It is no harder to raise big  healthy  blooming plants than weak  sickly little things   in fact it is easier . But you will never get better flowers than the seed you grow . Many people think that pansies last only a few weeks  then their period of growth and bloom is over . That is not true . If the plants are cared for and protected over the winter  the second year is more prolific than the first . Would you like to grow exhibition pansies   Remove about half the branches from each plant  leaving only the strongest with the largest buds . The flowers will be huge . Pansies have character . They stick to their principles  insist upon their due  but grow and bloom with dependable regularity if given it . Treat them right and theyll make a showing every month in the year except the frigid ones . Give them food  some shade  mulch  water and more food  and theyll repay your solicitude with beauty . A salad with greens and tomato is a popular and wonderfully healthful addition to a meal  but add an avocado and you have something really special . This delightful tropical fruit has become wellknown in the past thirty years because modern transportation methods have made it possible to ship avocados anywhere in the United States . It has a great many assets to recommend it and if you havent made avocado a part of your diet yet  you really should . You will find that avocado is unlike any other fruit you have ever tasted . It is roughly shaped like a large pear  and when properly ripened  its dark green skin covers a meaty  melonlike pulp that has about the consistency of a ripe Bartlett pear  but oily . The avocado should have a  give  to it  as you hold it  when it is ripe . The flavor is neither sweet  like a pear  nor tart like an orange   it is subtle and rather bland  nutlike . It is a flavor that might take a little getting used to  not because it is unpleasant  but because the flavor is hard to define in the light of our experience with other fruits . Sometimes it takes several  eatings  of avocado to catch that delightful quality in taste that has made it such a favorite throughout the world . Once you become an avocado fan  you will look forward to the season each year with eager anticipation . Naturally dormant and no spray danger Today  refrigerated carriers have made the shipping of avocados possible to any place in the world . The fruit is allowed to mature on the tree  but it is still firm at this point . It is brought to packing houses  cleaned and graded as to size and quality  and packed in protective excelsior . The fruit is then cooled to degreesF.  a temperature at which it lapses into a sort of dormant state . This cooling does not change the avocado in any way  it just delays the natural softening of the fruit until a grovelike temperature  room temperature  is restored . This happens on the grocers shelf or in your kitchen . One of the most attractive things about avocados is that they do not require processing of any kind . There is no dyeing or waxing or gassing needed . If the temperature is controlled properly  the avocado will delay its ripening until needed . And unlike other fruits  one cannot eat the skin of the avocado . It is thick  much like an egg plants skin  so that poison sprays  if they are used  present no hazard to the consumer . Nutritious and a cholesterol reducer Good taste and versatility  plus safety from spray poisons would be enough to recommend the frequent use of such a fruit  even if its nutritional values were limited . Avocados  however  are very rich in nutrients . Their main asset is an abundance of unsaturated fatty acids  so necessary for maintaining the good health of the circulatory system . Aside from this  the average portion contains some protein  an appreciable amount of vitamins A and C  about onetenth of the minimum daily requirement  and about a third of the official vitamin E requirement . The B vitamins are well represented  especially thiamin and riboflavin . Calcium  phosphorus and iron are present in worthwhile amounts  and eleven other minerals also have been found in varying trace amounts . None of these values is destroyed  not significantly altered by refrigeration storage . Dr. Wilson C. Grant  of the Veterans Administration Hospital  Coral Gables  Florida  and the University of Miami School of Medicine  set out to discover if avocados  because of their high content of unsaturated fatty acids  would reduce the cholesterol of the blood in selected patients . The study comprised  male patients  ranging in age from  to  . They were put on control diets to determine as accurately as possible  the normal cholesterol level of their blood . Then they were given  to  avocados per day as a substitute for part of their dietary fat consumption .\n",

There are three principal feed bunk types for dairy and beef cattle     Fenceline bunks  cattle eat from one side while feed is put in from the opposite side of the fence by selfunloading wagons      Mechanized bunks  they sit within the feed lot  are filled by a mechanical conveyor above feeding surface      Special bunks  as discussed here  they permit cattle to eat from all sides . Feed is put in with an elevator . Several materials or combinations of materials can be used to construct a satisfactory feed bunk . The selection of materials depends on skills of available labor for installation  cost of materials available locally  and your own preference . No one material is best for all situations . Selecting bunks by economic comparison is usually an individual problem . Fenceline feeding . Animals eat only from one side  so the fenceline bunk must be twice as long as the mechanical bunk . These bunks also serve as a fence  so part of the additional cost must be attributed to the fence . Because of their location  on the edge of the feed lot  fenceline bunks are not in the way of mechanical manure removal . Filling these bunks by the same selfunloading wagons used to fill silos spreads cost of the wagons over more time and operations . Allweather roads must be provided next to the feeding floor so access will be possible all year . This will be a problem in areas of heavy snowfall .\n",

            "Can thermonuclear war be set off by accident   What steps have been taken to guard against the one sort of mishap that could trigger the destruction of continents   Are we as safe as we should be from such a disaster   Is anything being done to increase our margin of safety   Will the danger increase or decrease   I have just asked these questions in the Pentagon  in the White House  in offices of key scientists across the country and aboard the submarines that prowl for months underwater  with neat rows of green launch tubes which contain Polaris missiles and which are affectionately known as  Sherwood Forest  . I asked the same questions inside the launchcontrol rooms of an Atlas missile base in Wyoming  where officers who wear sidearms are manning the  commit buttons  that could start a war  accidentally or by design  and in the command centers where other pistolpacking men could give orders to push such buttons . To the men in the instrumentjammed bomber cockpits  submarine compartments and the antiseptic  windowless rooms that would be the foxholes of tomorrows impersonal intercontinental wars  the questions seem farfetched . There is unceasing pressure  but its sources are immediate .  Readiness exercises  are almost continuous . Each could be the real thing . In the command centers there are special clocks ready to tick off the minutes elapsed since  E hour  .  E  stands for  execution   the moment a  go order  would unleash an American nuclear strike . There is little time for the men in the command centers to reflect about the implications of these clocks . They are preoccupied riding herd on control panels  switches  flashing colored lights on pale green or gray consoles that look like business machines . They know little about their machinery beyond mechanical details . Accidental war is so sensitive a subject that most of the people who could become directly involved in one are told just enough so they can perform their portions of incredibly complex tasks . Among the policy makers  generals  physicists  psychologists and others charged with controlling the actions of the button pushers and their  hardware   the answers to my questions varied partly according to a mans flair for what the professionals in this field call  scenarios  . As an Air Force psychiatrist put it   You cant have dry runs on this one  . The experts are thus forced to hypothesize sequences of events that have never occurred  probably never will  but possibly might . Only one rule prevailed in my conversations with these men  The more highly placed they are  that is  the more they know  the more concerned they have become . Already accidental war is a silent guest at the discussions within the Kennedy Administration about the urgency of disarmament and nearly all other questions of national security . Only recently new  holes  were discovered in our safety measures  and a search is now on for more . Work is under way to see whether new restraining devices should be installed on all nuclear weapons . Meanwhile  the experts speak of wars triggered by  false preemption    escalation    unauthorized behavior  and other terms that will be discussed in this report . They inhabit a secret world centered on  go codes  and  gold phones  . Their conversations were  almost invariably  accompanied by the same gestures  arms and pointed forefingers darting toward each other in arclike semicircular motions . One arm represented our bombers and missiles  the other arm  theirs  . Yet implicit in each movement was the death of millions  perhaps hundreds of millions  perhaps you and me  and the experts . These men are not callous . It is their job to think about the unthinkable . Unanimously they believe that the world would become a safer place if more of us  and more Russians and Communist Chinese  too  thought about accidental war . The first systematic thinking about this Pandoras box within Pandoras boxes was done four years ago by Fred Ikle  a frail  meekmannered Swissborn sociologist . He was  and is  with the RAND Corporation  a nonprofit pool of thinkers financed by the U.S. Air Force . His investigations made him the Paul Revere of accidental war  and safety procedures were enormously increased . In recent weeks  as a result of a sweeping defense policy reappraisal by the Kennedy Administration  basic United States strategy has been modified  and large new sums allocated  to meet the accidentalwar danger and to reduce it as quickly as possible . The chain starts at BMEWS  Ballistic Missile Early Warning System  in Thule  Greenland . Its radar screens would register Soviet missiles shortly after they are launched against the United States . BMEWS intelligence is simultaneously flashed to NORAD  North American Air Defense Command  in Colorado Springs  Colorado  for interpretation   to the SAC command and control post  fortyfive feet below the ground at Offutt Air Force Base  near Omaha  Nebraska   to the Joint War Room of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the Pentagon and to the President . Telephones  Teletypes  several kinds of radio systems and  in some cases  television  link all vital points . Alternate locations exist for all key command centers . For lastditch emergencies SAC has alternate command posts on KC jet tankers . Multiple circuits  routings and frequencies make the chain as unbreakable as possible . The same principle of  redundancy  applies to all communications on these special networks . And no messages can be transmitted on these circuits until senders and receivers authenticate in advance  by special codes  that the messages actually come from their purported sources . Additional codes can be used to challenge and counterchallenge the authentications . Only the President is permitted to authorize the use of nuclear weapons . Thats the law . But what if somebody decides to break it   The President cannot personally remove the safety devices from every nuclear trigger . He makes the momentous decision . Hundreds of men are required to pass the word to the button pushers and to push the buttons . What if one or more of them turn irrational or suddenly  coolly  decide to clobber the Russians   What if the President himself  in the language of the military   goes ape    Or singlehandedly decided to reverse national policy and hit the Soviets without provocation   Nobody can be absolutely certain of the answers . However  the system is designed  ingeniously and hopefully  so that no one man could initiate a thermonuclear war . Even the President cannot pick up his telephone and give a  go  order . Even he does not know the one signal for a nuclear strike  the  go code  . In an emergency he would receive available intelligence on the  goldphone circuit  . A system of  gold   actually yellow  phones connects him with the offices and action stations of the Secretary of Defense  the Joint Chiefs of Staff  the SAC commander and other key men . All can be connected with the gold circuit from their homes . All could help the President make his decision . The talk would not be in code  but neither would it ramble . Vital questions would be quickly answered according to a preprepared agenda . Officers who participate in the continual practice drills assured me that the Presidents decision could be made and announced on the gold circuit within minutes after the first flash from Aj . If communications work  his decision would be instantly known in all command posts that would originate the actual go order . For these centers  too  are on the gold circuit . They include the Navys Atlantic Command at Norfolk  Virginia  which is in contact with the Polaris subs   NATO headquarters in Europe   Air Force forward headquarters in Europe and in the Pacific  which control tactical fighters on ships and land bases   and SAC  which controls longrange bombers and Atlas missiles . Let us look in on one of these nerve centers  SAC at Omaha  and see what must still happen before a wing of B bombers could drop their Aj . In a word  plenty . The key man almost certainly would be Col. William W. Wisman  SACs senior controller . He or his deputy or one of their seven assistants  all full colonels  mans the heart of the command post twentyfour hours a day . It is a quiet but impressive room   feet long  thirtynine feet wide  twentyone feet high . Movable panels of floortoceiling maps and charts are crammed with intelligence information . And Bill Wisman  fortythree  a farmers son from Beallsville  Ohio  is a quiet but impressive man . His eyes are steady anchors of the deepest brown . His movements and speech are precise  clear and quick . No question ruffles him or causes him to hesitate . Wisman  who has had the chief controllers job for four years  calls the signals for a team operating three rows of dullgray consoles studded with lights  switches and buttons . At least a dozen men  some armed  are never far away from him . In front of him is a gold phone . In emergencies the SAC commander  Gen. Thomas Power  or his deputies and their staff would occupy a balcony that stretches across the length of the room above Wisman and his staff . At General Powers seat in the balcony there is also a gold phone . General Power would participate in the decision making . Wisman  below  would listen in and act . His consoles can give him instant contact with more than seventy bases around the world and with every SAC aircraft . He need only pick up one of the two red telephone receivers at his extreme left  right next to the big red button marked alert .  There are two receivers in case one should be dropped and damaged .  But Wisman  too  does not know the go code . He must take it from  the red box  . In point of fact  this is a beige box with a bright red door  about one and a half feet square and hung from the wall about six feet from the door to Wismans right . The box is internally wired so the door can never be opened without setting off a screeching klaxon   Its real obnoxious   . Now we must become vague  for we are approaching one of the nations most guarded secrets . The codes in the red box  there are several of them covering various contingencies  are contained in a sealed Xrayproof  unique device  . They are supplied  a batch at a time  by a secret source and are continually changed by Wisman or his staff  at random intervals . But even the contents of Wismans box cannot start a war . They are mere fragments  just one portion of preprepared messages . What these fragments are and how they activate the go order may not be revealed . The pieces must be placed in the context of the prepared messages by Wismans staff . In addition to the authentication and acknowledgment procedures which precede and follow the sending of the go messages  again in special codes  each message also contains an  internal authenticator   another specific signal to convince the recipient that he is getting the real thing . I asked Wisman what would happen if he broke out the go codes and tried to start transmitting one .  Id wind up full of bullet holes   he said  and there was no question that he was talking about bullets fired by his coworkers . Now let us imagine a wing of Bs  on alert near their  positive control  or failsafe  points   the spots on the map  many miles from Soviet territory  beyond which they are forbidden to fly without specific orders to proceed to their targets . They  too  have fragments of the go code with them . As Wisman put it   They have separate pieces of the pie  and we have the whole pie . Once we send out the whole pie  they can put their pieces into it . Unless we send out the whole pie  their pieces mean nothing  . Why does Wismans everchanging code always mesh with the fragments in possession of the button pushers   The answer is a cryptographic secret . At any rate  three men out of a sixman B crew are required to copy down Wismans gotowar message . Each must match Wismans  pie  with the fragment that he carries with him . All three must compare notes and agree to  go  . After that  it requires several minutes of concentrated work  including six separate and deliberate actions by a minimum of three men sitting at three separate stations in a bomber  each with another man beside him to help  for an armed bomb to be released . Unless all gadgets are properly operated  and the wires and seals from the handles removed first  no damage can be done .\n",

            "On April     the sturdy little threemasted bark  Discovery  weighed anchor in St. Katherines Pool  London  and floated down the Thames toward the sea . She carried  besides her captain  a crew of twentyone and provisions for a voyage of exploration of the Arctic waters of North America . Seventeen months later  on September     an Irish fishing boat sighted the Discovery limping eastward outside Galway Bay . When she reached port  she was found to have on board only eight men  all near starvation . The captain was gone  and the mate was gone . The man who now commanded her had started the voyage as an ordinary seaman . What disaster struck the Discovery during those seventeen months   What happened to the fourteen missing men   These questions have remained one of the great sea mysteries of all time . For hundreds of years  the evidence available consisted of    the captains fragmentary journal     a highly prejudiced account by one of the survivors     a note found in a dead mans desk on board  and    several secondhand reports . All told  they offered a highly confused picture . But since   researchers digging into ancient court records and legal files have been able to find illuminating pieces of information . Not enough to do away with all doubts  but sufficient to give a fairly accurate picture of the events of the voyage . Historians have had two reasons for persisting so long in their investigations . First  they wanted to clarify a tantalizing  bizarre enigma . Second  they believed it important to determine the fate of the captain  a man whose name is permanently stamped on our maps  on American towns and counties  on a great American river  and on half a million square miles of Arctic seas . The name  Henry Hudson . This is the story of his last tragic voyage  as nearly as we are able  or ever  probably  will be able  to determine  The sailing in the spring of  was Hudsons fourth in four years . Each time his objective had been the same  a direct water passage from Western Europe to the Far East . In  and   the English Muscovy Company had sent him northward to look for a route over the North Pole or across the top of Russia . Twice he had failed  and the Muscovy Company indicated it would not back him again . In   the Dutch East India Company hired Hudson  gave him two learned geographers  fitted him out with a ship called the Half Moon  and supplied him with Dutch sailors . This time he turned westward  to the middle Atlantic coast of North America . His chief discovery was important  the Great North  later  the Hudson  River  but it produced no northwest passage . When the Half Moon put in at Dartmouth  England  in the fall of   word of Hudsons findings leaked out  and English interest in him revived . The government forbade Hudson to return to Amsterdam with his ship . He thereupon went to London and spent the winter talking to men of wealth . By springtime  he was supported by a rich merchant syndicate under the patronage of Henry  Prince of Wales . He had obtained and provisioned a veteran ship called the Discovery and had recruited a crew of twentyone  the largest he had ever commanded . The purpose of this fourth voyage was clear . A century of exploration had established that a great land mass  North and South America  lay between Europe and the Indies . One by one  the openings in the coast that promised a passage through had been explored and discarded . In fact  Hudsons sail up the Great North River had disposed of one of the last hopes . But there remained one mysterious  unexplored gap  far to the north . Nearly twentyfive years before  Captain John Davis had noted  as he sailed near the Arctic Circle   a very great gulf  the water whirling and roaring  as it were the meeting of tides  . He named this opening  between Baffin Island and Labrador  the  Furious Overfall  .  Later  it was to be called Hudson Strait .  In   George Waymouth  in the same little Discovery that Hudson now commanded  had sailed  miles up the strait before his frightened men turned the ship back . Hudson now proposed to sail all the way through and test the seas beyond for the longsought waterway . Even Hudson  experienced in Arctic sailing and determined as he was  must have had qualms as he slid down the Thames . Ahead were perilous  icefilled waters . On previous voyages  it had been in precisely such dangerous situations that he had failed as a leader and captain . On the second voyage  he had turned back at the frozen island of Novaya Zemlya and meekly given the crew a certificate stating that he did so of his own free will  which was obviously not the case . On the third voyage  a nearmutiny rising from a quarrel between Dutch and English crew members on the Half Moon had almost forced him to head the ship back to Amsterdam in MidAtlantic . Worse  his present crew included five men who had sailed with him before . Of only one could he be sure  young John Hudson  his second son . The mate  Robert Juet  who had kept the journal on the Half Moon  was experienced  but he was a bitter old man  ready to complain or desert at any opportunity . Philip Staffe  the ships carpenter  was a good worker  but perversely independent . Arnold Lodley and Michael Perse were like the rest  lukewarm  ready to swing against Hudson in a crisis . But men willing to sail at all into waters where wooden ships could be crushed like eggs were hard to find . Hudson knew he had to use these men as long as he remained an explorer . And he refused to be anything else . It is believed that Hudson was related to other seafaring men of the Muscovy Company and was trained on company ships . He was a Londoner  married  with three sons .  The common misconception that he was Dutch and that his first name was Hendrik stem from Dutch documents of his third voyage .  In   Hudson was probably in his early forties  a good navigator  a stubborn voyager  but otherwise fatally unsuited to his chosen profession . Hudsons first error of the fourth voyage occurred only a few miles down the Thames . There at the rivers edge waited one Henry Greene  whom Hudson listed as a  clerk  . Greene was in actuality a young ruffian from Kent  who had broken with his parents in order to keep the company he preferred  pimps  panders and whores . He was not the sort of sailor Hudson wanted his backers to see on board and he had Greene wait at Gravesend  where the Discovery picked him up . For the first three weeks  the ship skirted up the east coast of Great Britain  then turned westward . On May   she reached Iceland . Poor winds and fog locked her up in a harbor the crew called  Lousie Bay  . The subsequent twoweeks wait made the crew quarrelsome . With Hudson looking on  his protege Greene picked a fight with the ships surgeon  Edward Wilson . The issue was settled on shore  Greene winning and Wilson remaining ashore  determined to catch the next fishing boat back to England . With difficulty  Hudson persuaded him to rejoin the ship  and they sailed from Iceland . Early in June  the Discovery passed  Desolation   southern Greenland  and in midJune entered the  Furious Overfall  . Floating ice bore down from the north and west . Fog hung over the route constantly . Turbulent tides rose as much as fifty feet . The ships compass was useless because of the nearness of the magnetic North Pole . As the bergs grew larger  Hudson was forced to turn south into what is now Ungava Bay  an inlet of the Great Strait . After finding that its coasts led nowhere  however  he turned north again  toward the main  icefilled passageway  and the crew  at first uneasy  then frightened  rebelled . The trouble was at least partly Juets doing . For weeks he had been saying that Hudsons idea of sailing through to Java was absurd . The great  crushing ice masses coming into view made him sound like the voice of pure reason . A group of sailors announced to Hudson that they would sail no farther . Instead of quelling the dissension  as many captains of the era would have done  Sir Francis Drake lopped a mans head off under similar circumstances   Hudson decided to be reasonable . He went to his cabin and emerged carrying a large chart  which he set up in view of the crew . Patiently  he explained what he knew about their course and their objectives . When Hudson had finished  the  town meeting  broke down into a general  wordy argument . One man remarked that if he had a hundred pounds  he would give ninety of them to be back in England . Up spoke carpenter Staffe  who said he wouldnt give ten pounds to be home . The statement was effective . The meeting broke up . Hudson was free to sail on . All through July the Discovery picked her way along the milelong strait  avoiding ice and rocky islands . On August   two massive headlands reared out of the mists  great gateways never before  so far as Hudson knew  seen by Europeans . To starboard was a cape a thousand feet high  patched with ice and snow  populated by thousands of screaming sea birds . To port was a point  feet high rising behind to a precipice of  feet . Hudson named the capes Digges and Wolstenholme  for two of his backers . Hudson pointed the Discovery down the east coast of the newly discovered sea  now called Hudson Bay   confident he was on his way to the warm waters of the Pacific . After three weeks swift sailing  however  the ship entered an area of shallow marshes and river deltas . The ship halted . The great  sea to the westwards  was a dead end . This must have been Hudsons blackest discovery . For he seemed to sense at once that before him was no South Sea  but the solid bulk of the North American continent . This was the bitter end  and Hudson seemed to know he was destined to failure . Feverishly  he tried to brush away this intuition . North and south  east and west  back and forth he sailed in the landlocked bay  plowing furiously forward until land appeared  then turning to repeat the process  day after day  week after week . Hundreds of miles to the north  the route back to England through the  Furious Overfall  was again filling with ice . The men were at first puzzled  then angered by the aimless tacking . Once more  Juets complaints were the loudest . Hudsons reply was to accuse the mate of disloyalty . Juet demanded that Hudson prove his charges in an open trial . The trial was held September  . Hudson  presiding  heard Juets defense  then called for testimony from crew members . Juet had made plentiful enemies  several men stepped forward . Hands on Bible  seaman Lodley and carpenter Staffe swore that Juet had tried to persuade them to keep muskets and swords in their cabins . Cook Bennett Mathues said Juet had predicted bloodshed on the ship . Others added that Juet had wanted to turn the ship homeward . Hudson deposed Juet and cut his pay . The new mate was Robert Bylot  talented but inexperienced . There were other shifts and pay cuts according to the way individuals had conducted themselves . The important result  however  was that Juet and Francis Clemens  the deposed boatswain  became Hudsons sworn enemies . As Hudson resumed his desperate crisscrossing of the little bay  every incident lessened the crews respect for him . Once  after the Discovery lay for a week in rough weather  Hudson ordered the anchor raised before the sea had calmed . Just as it was being hauled inboard  a sea hit the ship . Michael Butt and Adame Moore were thrown off the capstan and badly injured . The anchor cable would have been lost overboard  but Philip Staffe was on hand to sever it with his axe .\n",

            "Color was delayed until   the wide screen until the early fifties . Movement itself was the chief and often the only attraction of the primitive movies of the nineties . Each film consisted of fifty feet  which gives a running time of about one minute on the screen . As long as audiences came to see the movement  there seemed little reason to adventure further . Motionpicture exhibitions took place in stores in a general atmosphere like that of the penny arcade which can still be found in such urban areas as Times Square . Brief snips of actual events were shown  parades  dances  street scenes . The sensational and frightening enjoyed popularity  a train rushes straight at the audience  or a great wave threatens to break over the seats . An early Edison production was The Execution Of Mary  Queen Of Scots . The unfortunate queen mounted the scaffold   the headsman swung his axe   the head dropped off   end of film . An early film by a competitor of the Wizard of Menlo Park simply showed a long kiss performed by two actors of the contemporary stage . In the field of entertainment there is no spur to financial daring so effective as audience boredom  and the first decade of the new device was not over before audiences began staying away in large numbers from the simpleminded  oneminute shows . In response  the industry allowed the discovery of the motion picture as a form of fiction and thus gave the movies the essential form they have had to this day . Despite the sheer beauty and spectacle of numerous documentaries  art films  and travelogues  despite the impressive financial success of such a recent development as Cinerama  the movies are at heart a form of fiction  like the play  the novel  or the short story . Moreover  the most artistically successful of the nonfiction films have invariably borrowed the narrative form from the fiction feature . Thus such great American documentaries as The River and The Plow That Broke The Plains were composed as visual stories rather than as illustrated lectures . The discovery that movies are a form of fiction was made in the early years of this century and it was made chiefly by two men  a French magician  Georges Melies  and an American employee of Edison  Edwin S. Porter . Of the two  Porter is justly the better known  for he went far beyond the vital finding of fiction for films to take the first step toward fashioning a language of film  toward making the motion picture the intricate  efficient time machine that it has remained since  even in the most inept hands . Narrative time and film time Melies  however  out of his professional instincts as a magician  discovered and made use of a number of illusionary techniques that remain part of the vocabulary of film . One of these is the  dissolve   which makes possible a visually smooth transition from scene to scene . As the first scene begins to fade  the succeeding scene begins to appear . For a moment or two  both scenes are present simultaneously  one growing weaker  one growing stronger . In a series of fairy tales and fantasies  Melies demonstrated that the film is superbly equipped to tell a straightforward story  with beginning  middle and end  complications  resolutions  climaxes  and conclusions . Immediately  the film improved and it improved because in narrative it found a content based on time to complement its own unbreakable connection with time . Physically  a movie is possible because a series of images is projected one at a time at such a speed that the eye  remembers  the one that has gone before even as it registers the one now appearing . Linking the smoothly changing images together  the eye itself endows them with the illusion of movement . The  projection  time of painting and sculpture is highly subjective  varying from person to person and even varying for a given person on different occasions . So is the time of the novel . The drama in the theater and the concert in the hall both have a fixed time  but the time is fixed by the director and the players  the conductor and the instrumentalists  subject  therefore  to much variation  as record collectors well know . The time of the motion picture is fixed absolutely . The film consists of a series of still  transparent photographs  or  frames   mm.wide . Each frame comes between the light and the lens and is individually projected on the screen  at the rate  for silent movies  of  frames per second  and  for sound films   frames per second . This is the rate of projection   it is also the rate of photographing . Time is built into the motion picture  which cannot exist without time . Now time is also the concern of the fictional narrative  which is  at its simplest  the story of an action with  usually  a beginning  a middle  and an end  elements which demand time as the first condition for their existence . The  moving  picture of the train or the wave coming at the audience is  to be sure  more intense than a still picture of the same subject  but the difference is really one of degree   the cinematic element of time is merely used to increase the realism of an object which would still be reasonably realistic in a still photo . In narrative  time is essential  as it is in film . Almost everything about the movies that is peculiarly of the movies derives from a tension created and maintained between narrative time and film time . This discovery of Melies was vastly more important than his sometimes dazzling  magicians tricks produced on film . It was Porter  however  who produced the very first movie whose name has lived on through the half century of film history that has since ensued . The movie was The Great Train Robbery and its effects on the young industry and art were all but incalculable . Overnight  for one thing  Porters film multiplied the standard running time of movies by ten . The Great Train Robbery is a onereel film . One reel  from eight to twelve minutes  became the standard length from the year of Robbery    until Griffith shattered that limit forever with Birth Of A Nation in  . The reel itself became and still is the standard of measure for the movies . The material of the Porter film is simplicity itself   much of it has continued to be used over the years and the heart of it  good guys and bad guys in the old West  pretty well dominated television toward the end of the s . A band of robbers enters a railroad station  overpowers and ties up the telegraph operator  holds up the train and escapes . A posse is formed and pursues the robbers  who  having made their escape  are whooping it up with some wild  wild women in a honkytonk hideout . The robbers run from the hideout  take cover in a wooded declivity  and are shot dead by the posse . As a finale is appended a closeup of one of the band taking aim and firing his revolver straight at the audience . All this is simple enough  but in telling the story Porter did two important things that had not been done before . Each scene is shot straight through  as had been the universal custom  from a camera fixed in a single position  but in the outdoor scenes  especially in the capture and destruction of the outlaws  Porters camera position breaks  necessarily  with the camera position standard until then  which had been  roughly  that of a spectator in a center orchestra seat at a play . The plane of the action in the scene is not parallel with the plane of the film in the camera or on the screen . If the change  at first sight  seems minor  we may recall that it took the Italian painters about two hundred years to make an analogous change  and the Italian painters  by universal consent  were the most brilliant group of geniuses any art has seen . In that apparently simple shift Porter opened the way to the sensitive use of the camera as an instrument of art as well as a mechanical recording device . He did more than that . He revealed the potential value of the  cut  as the basic technique in the art of the film . Cutting  of course  takes place automatically in the creation of a film . The meaning of the word is quite physical  to begin with . The physical film is cut with a knife at the end of one complete sequence  and the cut edge is joined physically  by cement  to the cut edge of the beginning of the next sequence . If  as a home movie maker  you shoot the inevitable footage of your child taking its first steps  you have merely recorded an historical event . If  in preparing that shot for the inevitable showing to your friends  you interrupt the sequence to paste in a few frames of the childs grandmother watching this event  you have begun to be an artist in film   you are employing the basic technique of film   you are cutting . This is what Porter did . As the robbers leave the looted train  the film suddenly cuts back to the station  where the telegraphers little daughter arrives with her fathers dinner pail only to find him bound on the floor . She dashes around in alarm . The two events are taking place at the same time . Time and space have both become cinematic . We leap from event to event  including the formation of the posse  even though the events  in  reality  are taking place not in sequence but simultaneously  and not near each other but at a considerable distance . The  chase  as a standard film device probably dates from The Great Train Robbery  and there is a reason for the continued popularity of the device . The chase in itself is a narrative   it presumes both speed and urgency and it demands cutting  both from pursued to pursuer and from stage to stage of the journey of both . The simple  naked idea of one man chasing another is of its nature better fitted for the film than it is for any other form of fiction . The cowboy films  the cops and robbers films  and the slapstick comedy films culminating in an insane chase are not only catering to what critics may assume to be a vulgar taste for violence   these films and these sequences are also seeking out  instinctively or by design  the peculiarly cinematic elements of narrative . The creator of the art of the film  D.W. Griffith There still remained the need for one great film artist to explore the full potential of the new form and to make it an art . The man was D.W. Griffith . When he came to the movies  more or less by accident  they were still cheap entertainment capable of enthralling the unthinking for an idle few minutes . In about seven years Griffith either invented or first realized the possibilities of virtually every resource at the disposal of the film maker . Before he was forty Griffith had created the art of the film . Not that there had not been attempts  mostly European  to do exactly that . But in general the European efforts to make an art of the entertainment had ignored the slowly emerging language of the film itself . Staggeringly condensed versions of famous novels and famous plays were presented . Great actors and actresses  the most notable being Sarah Bernhardt  were hired to repeat their stage performances before the camera . In all of this extensive and expensive effort  the camera was downgraded to the status of recording instrument for art work produced elsewhere by the actor or by the author . The phonograph today  for all its high fidelity and stereophonic sound  is precisely what the early art purveyors in the movies wished to make of the camera . Not surprisingly  this approach did not work . The effort produced a valuable record of stage techniques in the early years of the century and some interesting records of great theater figures who would otherwise be only names . But no art at all was born of the art effort in the early movies .\n",

            "Die Frist ist um  und wiederum verstrichen sind sieben Jahr  the Maestro quoted The Flying Dutchman  as he told of his career and wanderings  explaining that the number seven had significantly recurred in his life several times . The music director of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra  William Steinberg  has molded his group into a prominent musical organization  which is his life . When he added to his Pittsburgh commitments the directorship of the London Philharmonic Orchestra in   he conducted one hundred fifty concerts within nine months   commuting  between the two cities . This schedule became too strenuous  even for the energetic and conscientious Mr. Steinberg . His London contract was rescinded  and now  he explains cheerfully  as a bright smile lightens his intense  mobile face   I conduct only one hundred and twenty concerts    Our meeting took place in May    during one of the Maestros stopovers in New York  before he left for Europe . As we began to converse in the lounge of his Fifth Avenue hotel  his restlessness and sensitivity to light and sound became immediately apparent . Seeking an obscure  dark  relatively quiet corner in the airy room otherwise suffused with afternoon sunshine  he asked if the soft background music could be turned off . Unfortunately  it was Muzak  which automatically is piped into the public rooms  and which nolens volens had to be endured . As he talked about himself  time and again stuffing and dragging on his pipe  Steinberg began to relax and the initial hurried feeling grew faint and was dispelled . Did he come from a musical family   Yes  though not professional musicians  they were a musicloving family . In his native Cologne  where his mother taught him to play the piano  he was able to read notes before he learned the alphabet . She even devised a system of colors  whereby the boy could easily distinguish the different note values . When he started school at the age of fiveandahalf  he could not understand why the alphabet begins with the letter A  instead of C  as in the scale . Because  like many other children  he intensely disliked practicing Czerny Etudes  he composed his own studies . When he was eight he began violin lessons . Soon he was playing in the Cologne Municipal Orchestra  and during World War    when musicians were scarce  he joined the opera orchestra as well . Steinberg claims that these early years of orchestra participation were of invaluable help to his career .  By observing the conductor   he says with a twinkle in his eyes   I learned how not to conduct  . The musician ran away from school when he was fifteen  but this escapade did not save him from the Gymnasium . Simultaneously  he pursued his musical studies at the conservatory  receiving sound training in counterpoint and harmony  as well in the violin and piano . His professional career began when he was twenty   he became Otto Klemperers personal assistant at the Cologne Opera  and a year later was promoted to the position of regular conductor . Wasnt this an unusually young age to fill such a responsible post   Yes  the Maestro assented . Had he always wished to be a conductor   No  originally he had hoped to become a concert pianist and had even performed as such . However  when he assumed the duties of a conductor  he relinquished his career as a pianist . Five years were spent with the Cologne Opera  after which he was called to Prague by Alexander von Zemlinsky  teacher of Arnold Schonberg and Erich Korngold . In  he succeeded Zemlinsky as opera director of the German Theater at Prague . During his tenure he also fulfilled guest engagements at the Berlin State Opera . Two years later he became director of the Frankfurt Opera  where he remained until he lost this position in  through the rise of the Hitler regime . During these years the youthful conductor had contributed greatly to the high level of musical life in Germany . He had presented the first German performances of Puccinis Manon Lescaut and De Fallas La Vida Breve . The Frankfurt years were particularly noteworthy for his performance of Bergs Wozzek soon after the Berlin premiere under Erich Kleiber  and the world premiere of Schonbergs Von heute auf morgen . At the outset of his career  Steinberg had dedicated himself to the advancement of contemporary music by vowing to do a Schonberg work every year . In Frankfurt  too  he directed the Museum and Opera House concerts which  in addition to the standard repertoire  featured novelties like Erdmanns Piano Concerto and Mahlers Sixth Symphony . Because of the political upheaval in Germany in the s  Steinberg was forced to restrict his activities to the Jewish community . Through the Frankfurt Jewish Kulturbund he began to give sonata recitals in synagogues  with Cellist Emanuel Feuermann . As more and more Jewish musicians lost their jobs with professional organizations Steinberg united them into the Frankfurt Kulturbund Orchestra  which also gave guest performances in other German cities . In  he accepted the leadership of the Berlin Kulturbund . In the fall of that year the best musicians of the Berlin and Frankfurt Kulturbund orchestras joined under the combined efforts of Bronislaw Hubermann and Steinberg to become the Palestine Orchestra  now known as the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra  with Steinberg as founderconductor . In   at the insistence of Arturo Toscanini  Steinberg left Germany for the United States  by way of Switzerland . After he had spent the first three years in New York as associate conductor  at Toscaninis invitation  of the NBC Orchestra  he made numerous guest appearances throughout the United States and Latin America . In  he became conductor of the Buffalo Philharmonic . Seven years later he was asked to become director of the Pittsburgh Symphony . Since  he has also conducted regularly at the San Francisco Opera  where he made his debut with a memorable performance of Verdis Falstaff . In recent years he has traveled widely in Europe  conducting in Italy  France  Austria  and Switzerland . He returned to Germany for the first time in   where he has since conducted in Cologne  Frankfurt  and Berlin . Where in Europe was he going now   First of all  to Italy for a short vacation  Forte Dei Marmi  a place he loves . Since it is not far from Viareggio  he will visit Puccinis house  as he never fails to do  to pay his respects to the memory of the composer of La Boheme  which he considers one of Puccinis masterpieces . Steinberg spoke with warmth and enthusiasm about Italy   Rome is my second home . I consider it the center of the world and make it a point to be there once a year  . He will conduct two concerts at the Accademia Di Santa Cecilia  as well as concerts in Munich and Cologne .  Then I return to the United States for engagements at the Hollywood Bowl and in Philadelphia   he added . The forthcoming season in Pittsburgh also promises to be of unusual interest . There will be premieres of new works  made possible through Ford Foundation commissions  Carlisle Floyds Mystery  with Phyllis Curtin as soprano soloist . Other world premieres will be Gardner Reads Third Symphony and Burle Marxs Samba Concertante .  And next year we will do  also a Ford commission  a piano concerto by Elliott Carter  with Jacob Lateiner as soloist . Of course  I shall conduct Mahler and Bruckner works in the coming season  as usual . Well play Bruckners Fifth Symphony in the original version  and Mahlers Seventh  the least accessible  known  and played of Mahlers works . My Pittsburghers have become real addicts to Mahler and Bruckner  . He added that he also stresses the works of these favorite masters on tour  especially Mahlers First and Fourth symphonies  and Das Lied Von der Erde  and Bruckners Sixth  which is rarely played  and Seventh . Bruckners Eighth he refers to as  my travel symphony  . He recalled that in California after a critic had attacked him for  still trying to sell Bruckner to the Americans   the publics response at the next concert was a standing ovation .  Now that Bruno Walter is virtually in retirement and my dear friend Dimitri Mitropoulos is no longer with us  I am probably the only one  with the possible exception of Leonard Bernstein  who has this special affinity for and champions the works of Bruckner and Mahler  . Since he introduces so much modern music  I could not resist asking how he felt about it .  There was always and at all times a contemporary music and it expresses the era in which it was created . But I usually stick to the old phrase   Ich habe ein Amt  aber keine Meinung  I hold an office  but I do not feel entitled to have an opinion  . I consider it to be my job to expose the public to what is being written today  . With all his musical activities  did he have the time and inclination to do anything else   He had just paid a brief visit to the Frick Collection to admire his favorite paintings by Rembrandt and Franz Hals . He was not enthusiastic over the newly acquired Claude Lorrain  but reminisced with pleasure over a Poussin exhibit he had been able to see in Paris a year ago . And how did he feel about modern art   Again Steinberg was cautious and replied with a smile that he was not exposed to it enough to hazard comments .  As my wife puts it   he said  again with a twinkle in his eyes   all you know is your music . But after all  you never learned anything else    What did he do for relaxation   Like his late colleague  Mitropoulos  he reads mystery stories  in particular Sir Arthur Conan Doyle . He cited Heine and Stendhal as favorites in literature . But his prime interest  apart from music  he insisted seriously  was his family  his wife  daughter and son . At the moment he was excited about his sons having received the Prix De Rome in archaeology and was looking forward to being present this summer at the excavation of an Etruscan tomb .  Both children are musical and my wife is a music lover of unfailing instinct and judgement  .  Is the attitude of German youth comparable to that of  the angry young men  of England    Was the topic for a roundtable discussion at the Bayerische Rundfunk in Munich . I was chairman  the only not youthful participant . Since attack serves to stimulate interest in broadcasts  I added to my opening statement a sentence in which I claimed that German youth seemed to lack the enthusiasm which is a necessary ingredient of anger  and might be classified as uninterested and bored rather than angry . I was far from convinced of the truth of my statement  but could not think of anything that might evoke responses more quickly .  It is easy for you to talk    countered a twenty year old law student   you travel around the world . We would like to do that too  .  But you want a job guaranteed when you return   I continued my attack .  You must have some security   said a young clerk . When I mentioned that for my first long voyage I did not even have the money for the return fare  but had trusted to luck that I would earn a sufficient amount  the young people looked at me doubtingly . One girl expressed what was obviously in their minds .  Would you advise us to act the same way   You might have failed . I think it is rather foolhardy to trust to luck  . Others mentioned that I might have had to ask friends or even strangers for help and that to be stranded in a foreign country without sufficient funds did not contribute to international understanding . The debate needed no additional controversy and soon I could ask each individually what he expected from life  what his hopes were and what his fears . Though the four boys and two girls  the youngest nineteen years of age  the oldest twentyfour  came from varying backgrounds and had different professional and personal interests  there was surprising agreement among them . What they wished for most was security   what they feared most was war or political instability in their own country . The ideal home  they agreed  would be a small private house or a city apartment of four to five rooms  just enough for a family consisting of husband  wife  and two children . No one wanted a larger family or no children  and none hoped for a castle or said that living in less settled circumstances would be satisfactory . All expressed interest in world affairs but no one offered to make any sacrifices to satisfy this interest .\n",

            "The average reader of this magazine owns more than one gun  we ran a survey to find out  but hes always on the lookout for new and better arms . Hes more than a reader of outdoor articles   hes a real hunter and shooter  eager to improve his sport . Well  if youre that kind of sportsman were here to help you . Youve probably given a lot of Christmasseason thought to the guns in your rack  but its not easy to decide on a new one . You still have time to drop a few hints about the gifts youd appreciate most   the time to decide on them is now . As a Christmas service  Ive taken a close look at this years crop of new models . Here they are  with my comments and judgments . Read on  take your pick  and start dropping those hints . First on my own list would be two arms  a rifle and a handgun  that qualify as new in the strictest sense . For me  a changed barrel length or an improved stock doesnt constitute a truly new design . Such modifications are all for the best but it takes something as different as a Deerstalker or a Jet to change armsmaking concepts . Bill Rugers longawaited Deerstalker  under   is a new rifle action in a caliber that upsets all the modern theory of highvelocity fans   its a short  light  quickhandling  fastfiring little timber gun designed to push a heavy slug at modest velocity but with lots of killing power and ample range for our most popular big game  whitetail . Ruger reports that on his recent African safari the little Magnum cartridge was a real work horse . Small antelope were generally grassed with one shot  and the Magnum carbine also bagged reedbuck  kob and wart hog with deadly efficiency   these are fairly large  tough animals . The deadliness of the Magnum in a rifle comes as no surprise to me . At least five years ago  Tom Robinson of Marlin made up an overunder double rifle for me in this caliber  using the now defunct Model  action in gauge size . After figuring out how to regulate the barrels so that they shot to the same point of impact  we fired this little inchbarrel job on my home range and in Marlins underground test gallery . We quickly ran into the same trouble that plagued Bill Ruger in his first experiments  Three or four bullets would be placed well in a sixinch bull at  yards and then  unaccountably  one could stray far out of the group . Ruger learned that this was because the higher velocity achieved in a long barrel was upsetting the shape of the unjacketed revolver bullet . The new  jacketed slug in Magnum corrected this . But even without jacketed bullets  I had enough faith in my double to take it on an openingday deer hunt that first year . Within half an hour I jumped a sixpoint buck that hopskipped through a rhododendron thicket  and I caught him just behind the left foreleg at  yards . He moved only about  feet after the grain slug hit him  and this was after the bullet had passed through a sapling . Three more deer have fallen to this same gun  and all were oneshot kills . My double was made with standardweight revolver barrels  before cutting to revolver length   and although it compares well in other respects  its considerably heavier than the Deerstalker  which only scales about  pounds . If ever a rifle met the needs of the whitetail hunter  this is it . The Deerstalker points with the ease  speed and precision of a fine imported double shotgun  and its trigger pull is light and sharp . The grain bullet leaves the muzzle at  fps  which gives it all the smash needed at woods ranges . With five shots at the immediate command of the hunters trigger finger  the gun and load are a deadly combination . The second really new development this year was a revolver handling a different sort of varmint load  the Remington Jet Magnum Center Fire . At present its available in one model  the fine and familiar Smith  Wesson Magnum revolver  about    long a topquality handgun among target arms . The velocity of this  grain bullet is rated at a very hot  fps  and its the flattest shooting of any revolver cartridge  with a midrange rise of about an inch over a yard range . This is a varmint load  pure and simple   its much too explosive for small edible game . It can cut a red squirrel neatly in two or burst a crow into a flurry of feathers . The most intriguing aspect of the S  W Magnum chambered for the new Jet is that it can also fire standard rimfires by means of adapter sleeves in the chambers . You may therefore convert the gun into a smallgame and plinking arm  although the difference in the point of impact  Jet vs. rimfire  can be somewhat disconcerting . The accuracy of the Jet cartridge is fine   I tested it in my scoped S  W and it was good enough to allow me to hit a chuck with every shot at  yards if I did my part by holding the handgun steadily . Hunting rifles   The fact that the Deerstalker and the Jet were the only completely new designs this year doesnt mean that  didnt see changes in models  actions and calibers . Aside from the Ruger carbine  a number of hunting rifles have been introduced for the first time . Here are the brands  in alphabetical order  and the new models . Newcomers to the American hunter are the Browning group of boltaction  highpower rifles . They have fine FN actions and a betterthanaverage finish on both the metal and the stock wood . Barrel weights vary sensibly with the various calibers available  and these include the standard bores  about   plus the Magnums  around     the latter include the  S  H   and . Shotguntype rubber recoil pads are standard on all of the Magnums except the . Stock designs are excellent for use with scopes . Colts centerfire  rifles are all made with Sako actions  regardless of caliber . The have the short action   the and  the medium action  and the  Af and the Magnums  the long action  about  for the Standard Coltsman and  for the Custom version  . Previously  FN actions were used for the larger cartridges . High Standard has introduced a auto  the SportKing  in two grades  field and special  less than  and just over   respectively  . Its a streamlined rifle  fast and wellmade . Among Magnum RimFire rifles  s lone newcomer was the Kodiak Model  autoloader  around   . Previously known as Jefferson Arms  Kodiak has given this shot hammerless job an exceptionally fine stock design  and the  is the first autoloader to handle Magnum rimfires . Marlin has made two contributions to the harvest of new offerings . The Model   under   is a lightweight  streamlined rimfire auto with a tubular magazine that holds  Long Rifles . Its extremely accurate for an auto  and the test rifle I tried was completely troublefree in functioning . The   about   is an even newer auto  this one with a seven or shot clip . Once again the Mossberg Targo outfit has appeared  but this time as a boltaction rifleshotgun combination . The bore is unrifled but is provided with an insert tube which is rifled and which  surprisingly  gives pretty fair accuracy even though its only  inches long . You can unscrew this tube and replace it with a smoothbore insert for use with shotshells  to break the little Targo clay targets . A trap for throwing these miniature clays fastens to the barrel so that the shooter can throw his own targets . A spring trap for solid mounting and a regular hand trap are also available . You can have your choice of a sevenshot repeater  the TR  about   or a singleshot  the TR   less  . The Targo is a good outfit for fun shooting or for economic wingshooting practice  but its tougher than it looks to run up a score on the clay birds . Theyll travel  feet or more when thrown from the spring trap but its almost impossible to break one after it passes the foot mark . The combination of thin pattern and very tiny pellets makes it necessary to get on the birds  right now   Big Magnum calibers appeared in the Remington line for   with the addition of the and to the list of Model s . These are made on special order only  in Kodiak grade  about    with integral muzzle brakes and heavy rubber recoil pads   they weigh around nine pounds . A shortened version of the highly regarded Remington  autoloader also appeared in  . This carbine  under   about  more for a deluxe grade  has an inch barrel and was obviously inspired by the popularity of last years Model  pump with a shortbarrel . This design is hard to beat for timber hunting or for packing in a saddle scabbard . Presently  the C is available in Af . The latest versions of the famous Savage Model  are the  Featherweight  about   and the  Deluxe  under    which have a toptang safety and improved trigger design . The replacement of the slidelock side safety catch will make this leveraction favorite more appealing than ever since the new safety is easier and faster to operate . Beginners guns   A fresh crop of beginners guns showed up in   and theyre good bets for your Christmas gift list if youre wondering what to get for a youngster . The most unusual of them is the Ithaca   about    for a saddle scabbard   a leveraction singleshot patterned after the famous Winchester leveraction and featuring the Western look . Because of its traditional lines  it probably has more kid appeal than any other model . The action is a dropblock  handling all the standard rimfires . Marlins latest is also designed for the beginning shooter  although its a fullsized rifle with plenty of barrel weight and ample stock . This is the Model   about     its a singleshot boltaction with an automatic safety  i.e.  the safety goes on every time the bolt is lifted and the gun cocked for the next shot . Stock design is excellent  and this model is a good first gun . Another boys model is the singleshot Remington C  around    which comes with a inch barrel and a short  inch  stock   its just right for a boy of  . A beginners shotgun has also been introduced this year . The singlebarrel Stevens Y  under   is made with a side lever rather than a toptang lever because many youngsters arent strong enough to operate a top tang to open a gun  and the side lever does indeed open very easily . This gun has a inch stock and is available in either  or gauge . Theres another addition to the Stevens line  the pumpaction Model  in  under    which you may or may not consider a kids gun   many experienced hunters like this gauge and type of scattergun too . Shotguns   Although there were no startling developments in shotgun design this year  a number of new models and variations of existing models did hit the market . For example  a Browning trap version of the Superposed overunder  the Broadway  from  up  depending on grade   differs from standard models in that it is equipped with a full beavertail fore end  a cushion recoil pad and a barrelwide ventilated rib for fast sighting . The Colt line now includes a new scattergun  the Standard or Custom Pump Model  about  and   respectively  in    and  . Firearms International has introduced another import  this one from Finland . Its the Valmet  about    a gauge overunder very much like the old Remington   which was so fine a gun that today a used one still brings high prices . High Standard has also added two models to its line . The Supermatic Trophy  prices begin at less than  and depend on grade and optional features  is a gauge auto . The FliteKing Trophy  beginning at just over   is a pump gun in  or  . Either model is a very good dollar value . Mossbergs latest contribution to the field is the Model   from .    this is an improved version of the old Model   a pumpaction gauge shotgun . See page  for a complete report on it . Handguns   Aside from the Jet  which I coupled with the Deerstalker carbine as one of the years two biggest developments  few significant innovations appeared among s handguns .\n",

            "Orlando  Fla.  Feb.   The best yearold pacing mile up to date at Ben White Raceway has been that of Mary Liner  MainlinerHighland Ellen   a member of the Dick Williams stable  who was clocked  . She is owned by Ralph H. Kroening  Milwaukee  Wis.  who  according to the railbirds  can feel justly proud of her . Other good miles have been by Debonnie  Dale FrostDebby Hanover  and Prompt Time  AdiosOn Time  in    Kimberly Gal  GalophoneKimberly Hanover  .   Laguerre Hanover  Tar HeelLotus Hanover  and Monel  Tar HeelMiracle Byrd  in  . Laguerre Hanover is outstanding in type and conformation  good body  plenty of heart girth  stands straight on his legs on excellent feet  and has the smoothest gait . This colt is behind most of the other yearolds in the Simpson stable but can show about as much pace as any of them . Monel shows improvement with each workout and looks the makings of a good brood mare after winning her share of races . Stardel  Stars PrideStarlette Hanover     looks quite promising . Fury Hanover  Hoot MonFay   Caper  Hoot MonColumbia Hanover  and Isaac  Hoot MonGoddess Hanover  has been working together but have not equalled their best work done some weeks ago . Fury and Caper worked in  and did it with ease . They are two good colts of different type . Fury is upstanding and on the rangy side  and Caper is more the compact type . I have never seen Caper off his feet  he seems to know nothing but  trot  and keeps trying a little harder if asked to do so . Fury has made a few mistakes but looks like a wonderful prospect  with his impressive gait and stride which certainly make him cover the ground . Trackdown  TorridMighty Lady  has worked a mile in . . It took this colt several weeks to strike a pace . Then  after emasculation  he was eased up for a couple of weeks . He has thrived on all he has gone through and looks the makings of a good little race horse . Thor Hanover  AdiosTrustful Hanover  is a wonderful looking prospect and another good individual  with solid  rugged conformation  good  flat bone and excellent feet . This colt arrived at the Raceway early last November  and immediately was put into harness and linedriven for a few days  and then put to cart and broken in very nicely  knowing nothing but trot . He appeared in the hopples about November   was treated for worms on the th  the latter date being the first time he struck a real pace . On December  he paced a mile in  on the twicearound  out in third position all the way . This colt has done everything asked of him  and done it with ease . His best mile to date is . . Gamecock  Tar HeelTerka Hanover  is another promising colt  and his best time is . . This is one of the besttempered Tar Heels ever at the center . The first time he was harnessed he stood like a gentle old mare   the crupper under his tail seemed to be old stuff . The fourth time in harness he walked off like a gentleman . Being blistered for curbs has delayed his work somewhat . But up to date he has shown as much as any in the big Simpson stable . Hustler  Knight DreamTorkin  is a playful bay rascal of a colt  not the best gaited  but he surely can pace and is right there with them  and sometimes leading them  in the best miles . Torrid Freight  TorridBreeze On Hal  is a very rugged  strongmade colt with a wonderful stride who has done with ease everything asked of him . His best time is around  . Strongheart  AdiosDirect Gal   a fairlooking sorrel colt  knows nothing but pace and has been right there in the best miles . Torrid Adios  TorridAdios Molly  is not so masculine as most of the colts  but I like his type and he certainly is one of the bestgaited pacers on the grounds . Blistered for curbs and laid off three weeks  he is coming along fine and looks like a pacer to me . First Flyer  Frisco FlyerCastle Light  looks like a splendid candidate for the Illinois Stakes . His best time is . . The colts in Simpsons stable have little if anything on the fillies  especially the pacers . Justine Hanover  Sampson HanoverJustitia Hanover  is improving with each workout and paced . weeks ago . Mrs. Freight  Knight DreamMiss Reed  shows promise and does it in good form  and her best time is about  . Hoopla  Tar HeelHoliday Hanover   a filly that wanted to trot  knocked herself October  and November  fighting the hopples . She was then trained on the trot until December   hitched to a breaking cart once around the halfmile track and hoppled again . This time she submitted and in a few days was going good . On January  she paced a mile in .   on Jan.  ..   on Jan.     . This filly is a much better individual than either of her fullsisters  Valentine Day and Cerise  more scale and much better underpinning . She is more like her full brother  Taraday Hanover  but larger . Up to date she is a grandlooking filly . Pete Dailey has four promising yearold pacers . Marquis Pick  Gene AbbeDirect Grattan  seems to be the pick of the stable at the present time . He is a finelooking colt with a good body  good set of legs and nice way of going . His best mile to date is  . Majestic Pick comes next  with a mile in . . This colt is another finelooking equine . Staley Hanover  Knight DreamSweetmite Hanover  is a little on the small side but a very compact colt and looks like one to stand training and many future battles with colts in his class . Best time to date is  . Step Aside  Direct RhythmWily Widow  has worked in  on the halfmile track and shows promise . Most of Billy Haughtons yearolds have worked from  to  . Bonnie Wick  Gene AbbeScotch Mary  has gone in    Hickory Ash  Titan HanoverMisty Hanover  in  . The first time I saw the latter filly she trotted by me and I noticed such a family resemblance that I said to myself   that must be Hickory Ash  . She is a beautiful filly and likes to trot .

The lastnamed is one of the favorites in the stable  and the boys like her very much . I will be able to tell you more about this string of equines in the near future . I have just seen Debonnie and Prompt Time work a mile in   last quarter in . . In going away Debonnie got behind several lengths  stalling at the start  she is a little fussy . They left the threequarters together and finished almost together . Prompt Time shows class . This filly is another Adios that wants to trot  and trot she did until forced to do otherwise . After well broken and equipped with oz. shoes on behind  barefooted in front  she would trot a real storm with the master  Delvin  driving . Being placed in the hopples she was completely baffled . She hesitated  she hopped  she rolled and rocked  skipped and jumped  but in some two weeks she started to pace  From that time to this she has shown steady improvement and now looks like one of the classiest things on the grounds . Rain on Friday prevented many workouts  but there were a few miles of note on Thursday . Those responsible included Stardel Hanover  Stars PrideStarlette Hanover   .
